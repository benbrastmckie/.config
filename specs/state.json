      "description": "Add plan file status verification to /implement GATE OUT checkpoint and make implementation skills more explicit about plan file updates. Currently plan files are not reliably updated to [COMPLETED] status after implementation finishes (documented in skills but not executed). Fix: (1) Add verification step in implement.md GATE OUT that checks plan file status matches task status and updates if needed (defensive backup), (2) Make the sed command in skills Stage 7 more explicit with error checking and verification output.",
