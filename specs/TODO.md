# TODO

## Tasks

### 40. Standardize multi-task creation patterns
- **Effort**: 4-6 hours
- **Status**: [NOT STARTED]
- **Language**: meta

**Description**: Check all commands/skills/agents that create tasks, ensuring multi-task creators use the interactive selection pattern from /learn (user selects which to create and how to group them). Standardize the dependency display and task creation order pattern from /meta (topological sorting, layered graph visualization). Create a common best practice pattern to be used consistently across: /task --review, /errors, /review, /learn, /meta, and any other multi-task creators.
