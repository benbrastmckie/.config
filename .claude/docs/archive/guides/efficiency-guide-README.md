## Reason for Archival

This file was consolidated with `performance-measurement.md` to eliminate redundancy (approximately 30% content overlap) and improve documentation organization.

## New Location

The content from this file has been merged into:

**[Performance Optimization Guide](../../guides/performance-optimization.md)**

## What Changed

The new consolidated guide includes:
- **Part 1: Performance Measurement** (from performance-measurement.md)
  - Context usage measurement
  - Time savings benchmarking
  - Metadata extraction validation
  - End-to-end workflow performance
  - Phase 0 optimization metrics

- **Part 2: Workflow Efficiency Enhancements** (from this file)
  - Dynamic agent selection
  - Progress streaming
  - Intelligent parallelization
