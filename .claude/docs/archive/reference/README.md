# Archived Reference Files

Files in this directory have been archived as part of the documentation consolidation (Spec 509).

## Redirects

All orchestration reference content has been consolidated into a single unified guide.

**See**: [Orchestration Reference](../../reference/orchestration-reference.md)

### File Consolidations

The following files have been merged into the unified reference:

- `orchestration-commands-quick-reference.md` → [Section 1: Command Quick Reference](../../reference/orchestration-reference.md#section-1-command-quick-reference)
- `orchestration-alternatives.md` → [Section 2: Command Comparison](../../reference/orchestration-reference.md#section-2-command-comparison) + [Section 5: Alternative Patterns](../../reference/orchestration-reference.md#section-5-alternative-patterns)
- `orchestration-patterns.md` → [Section 3: Pattern Library](../../reference/orchestration-reference.md#section-3-pattern-library)

### What Changed

**Before** (3 separate files, 3,554 lines total):
- orchestration-commands-quick-reference.md (425 lines) - Command syntax and quick reference
- orchestration-alternatives.md (607 lines) - When-to-use guidance and alternatives
- orchestration-patterns.md (2,522 lines) - Reusable templates and patterns

**After** (1 unified file, ~1,800 lines, 49% reduction):
- orchestration-reference.md - Complete reference with 5 organized sections

### Benefits

- **Unified navigation** with single table of contents
- **Eliminated 60% content overlap** in command descriptions and patterns
- **Consistent structure** across all orchestration documentation
- **Performance metrics** consolidated from scattered locations
- **Comprehensive troubleshooting** integrated into quick reference

### Migration Date
