# Documentation Archive

This directory contains historical documentation preserved for reference purposes.

## Purpose

These documents represent previous implementations, migration guides, or architectural approaches that have been superseded by current documentation. They are retained for:

- Historical context
- Understanding past design decisions
- Reference during troubleshooting
- Audit trail of system evolution

## Important Notice

**These documents are historical references. See main docs for current implementation.**

For current, up-to-date documentation, refer to the main documentation directory at [.claude/docs/README.md](../README.md).
