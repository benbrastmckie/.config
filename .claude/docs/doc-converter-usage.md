# Document Converter Agent - Quick Start Guide

This guide shows you how to use the doc-converter agent to batch convert Word and PDF files to Markdown.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the required tools installed (already in your NixOS config):
- `pandoc` - For DOCX conversion
- `marker-pdf` - For PDF conversion

Verify installation:
```bash
which pandoc      # Should show: /nix/store/.../bin/pandoc
which marker_pdf  # Should show path to marker_pdf
```

## Usage Methods

### Method 1: Using the /convert-docs Command (Recommended)

The simplest way to convert documents:

```bash
# Convert documents in current directory
/convert-docs .

# Convert from specific directory
/convert-docs ~/Documents/Reports

# Specify output directory
/convert-docs ~/Documents/Reports ~/Documents/Markdown
```

### Method 2: Direct Agent Invocation

For more control, invoke the agent directly in your conversation:

```
Please use the doc-converter agent to convert all Word and PDF files
from ~/Documents/Research/ to markdown in ~/Documents/Markdown/.
```

The agent will:
1. Discover all DOCX and PDF files
2. Convert them using optimal tools
3. Extract images to organized directories
4. Validate conversions
5. Report detailed statistics

## Example Workflow

### Converting a Directory of Documents

**Your request**:
```
I have research papers (PDF) and notes (DOCX) in ~/Documents/Papers/.
Convert them all to markdown in ~/Documents/Markdown/.
```

**Agent response**:
```
I'll convert all documents from ~/Documents/Papers/ to Markdown.

PROGRESS: Discovering documents in ~/Documents/Papers/...
Found 8 DOCX files and 12 PDF files.

PROGRESS: Converting DOCX (1 of 8): research_notes.docx...
PROGRESS: Converting DOCX (2 of 8): project_summary.docx...
...
PROGRESS: Converting PDF (1 of 12): academic_paper_2024.pdf...
PROGRESS: Converting PDF (2 of 12): technical_report.pdf...
...
PROGRESS: Validating conversions...
PROGRESS: Conversion complete: 19 succeeded, 1 failed

Summary:
- DOCX conversions: 8 succeeded, 0 failed
- PDF conversions: 11 succeeded, 1 failed
- Total: 19 markdown files created
- Images extracted: 143 files

Failed conversions:
- encrypted_paper.pdf: Password-protected (needs manual unlock)

Output location: ~/Documents/Markdown/
Images location: ~/Documents/Markdown/images/

Recommendations:
- Spot-check 2-3 converted files for quality
- For encrypted_paper.pdf, unlock and re-run conversion
```

## Output Structure

After conversion, you'll have:

```
output_directory/
├── file1.md              # Converted markdown files
├── file2.md
├── file3.md
├── ...
├── images/               # Extracted images organized by source file
│   ├── file1/
│   │   ├── image1.png
│   │   └── image2.jpg
│   ├── file2/
│   │   └── diagram.png
│   └── ...
└── conversion.log        # Detailed conversion log
```

## Common Use Cases

### 1. Converting Legacy Documentation

**Scenario**: You have old Word docs you want to version control

```
Convert all DOCX files in ~/OldDocs/ to markdown in ~/NewDocs/markdown/.
Preserve all images and formatting.
```

### 2. Extracting Content from PDFs

**Scenario**: Research papers or reports you want as markdown

```
Convert all PDF files in ~/Research/papers/ to markdown.
These are academic papers with tables and figures.
Use high-quality conversion settings.
```

### 3. Batch Processing Mixed Documents

**Scenario**: Directory with both Word and PDF files

```
I have a mix of Word docs and PDFs in ~/Documents/Archive/.
Convert everything to markdown in ~/Documents/Converted/.
```

## Quality Checking

After conversion, the agent will report:

**Automatic Checks**:
- File sizes (warns if suspiciously small)
- Heading counts
- Table counts
- Image reference counts

**Manual Review** (recommended for important docs):
1. Open 2-3 converted files
2. Check headings hierarchy
3. Verify tables format correctly
4. Confirm images display properly
5. Test any links

## Troubleshooting

### "pandoc not found"

Your home-manager config should have installed it. If not:
```bash
cd ~/.dotfiles
home-manager switch
```

### "marker_pdf not found"

Make sure marker_pdf is in your home.nix:
```bash
cd ~/.dotfiles
home-manager switch
```

### PDF Conversion Fails

Common reasons:
- **Password-protected**: Unlock PDF first
- **Scanned PDF**: marker-pdf should handle, but quality varies
- **Corrupted file**: Try opening PDF manually to verify

Try alternative tools for difficult PDFs:
```bash
# Alternative: docling
pip install --user docling
python -c "from docling.document_converter import DocumentConverter; converter = DocumentConverter(); result = converter.convert('file.pdf'); print(result.document.export_to_markdown())" > output.md
```

### DOCX Conversion Issues

If Pandoc fails:
```bash
# Try simpler format
pandoc input.docx -t markdown -o output.md

# Or without media extraction
pandoc input.docx -t gfm -o output.md
```

## Advanced Usage

### Custom Conversion Script

The agent can generate standalone scripts for recurring conversions:

```
Generate a bash script for converting documents that I can run regularly.
Input: ~/Documents/Active/
Output: ~/Documents/Markdown/
```

The agent will create a reusable script with:
- Error handling
- Logging
- Statistics reporting
- Safe filename handling

### Filtering by Type

Convert only specific file types:

```
Convert only PDF files from ~/Research/, skip any DOCX files.
```

or

```
Convert only DOCX files from ~/Notes/, ignore PDFs.
```

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Organize before converting**: Clean up file names (remove special characters)
2. **Test with samples**: Try 2-3 files first to check quality
3. **Check file sizes**: Very large files (>100 pages) take longer
4. **Review output**: Spot-check conversions, especially tables and images
5. **Keep originals**: Never delete source files until you've verified conversions

## Performance Expectations

**Typical conversion times**:
- DOCX (Pandoc): 2-5 seconds per file
- PDF (marker-pdf): 5-15 seconds per file
- Large PDFs (50+ pages): 30-60 seconds per file

**Batch processing**:
- 10 files: ~1 minute
- 50 files: ~5-10 minutes
- 100+ files: ~15-30 minutes

## Integration with Neovim

You can invoke the agent directly from Neovim using the Claude Code integration:

1. Open command palette: `<leader>ac` (or `:ClaudeCommands`)
2. Search for "convert-docs"
3. Press Enter to execute

Or use the slash command directly:
```vim
:Claude /convert-docs ~/Documents/Papers ~/Documents/Markdown
```
