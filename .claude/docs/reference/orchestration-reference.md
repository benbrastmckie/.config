## Section 1: Command Quick Reference

### Commands Overview

| Command | Purpose | Phases | Delegation Rate | Use Case |
|---------|---------|--------|-----------------|----------|
| `/orchestrate` | Full-featured workflow | 7 | >90% | Complex multi-phase projects with PR automation |
| `/coordinate` | Wave-based parallel | 7 | >90% | Fast parallel implementation (40-60% time savings) |
| `/research` | Hierarchical research | 4 | >90% | Deep topic investigation with automatic decomposition |
| `/supervise` | Sequential workflow | 7 | >90% | Step-by-step orchestration with proven compliance |

**Common Features**:
- Parallel research (2-4 agents)
- Automated complexity evaluation
- Conditional debugging
- <30% context usage
- 100% file creation reliability

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Research a topic
/research "API authentication patterns and best practices"

# Coordinate full workflow
/coordinate "implement OAuth 2.0 authentication"

# Supervise step-by-step
/supervise "research and plan user authentication system"

# Full orchestration with PR
/orchestrate "add JWT authentication to API"
```

### Common Options

```bash
# Dry run (validate without execution)
/coordinate "test workflow" --dry-run

# Specify output location
/research "topic" --output-dir specs/custom_location

# Resume from checkpoint
/coordinate "workflow" --resume

# Create PR after completion
/orchestrate "feature" --create-pr

# Enable dashboard tracking
/orchestrate "feature" --dashboard
```

### Workflow Phases

All orchestration commands follow this 7-phase structure:

```
Phase 0: Location Detection (85% reduction, 25x speedup)
  ↓
Phase 1: Research (2-4 parallel agents, metadata extraction)
  ↓
Phase 2: Planning (complexity evaluation, forward message pattern)
  ↓
Phase 3: Implementation (wave-based parallel, 40-60% savings)
  ↓
Phase 4: Testing (per Testing Protocols, conditional)
  ↓
Phase 5: Debugging (conditional, parallel investigations)
  ↓
Phase 6: Documentation (summary + cross-references)
  ↓
Phase 7: Summary (artifact lifecycle tracking)
```

### Agent Invocation Pattern

#### Correct Pattern (Imperative)

```markdown
**EXECUTE NOW**: USE the Bash tool to calculate paths:

```bash
source .claude/lib/unified-location-detection.sh
topic_dir=$(create_topic_structure "topic_name")
report_path="$topic_dir/reports/001_subtopic.md"
echo "REPORT_PATH: $report_path"
```

**EXECUTE NOW**: USE the Task tool with these parameters:

- subagent_type: "general-purpose"
- description: "Research authentication patterns"
- prompt: |
    Read and follow: .claude/agents/research-specialist.md

    Research topic: Authentication patterns for REST APIs
    Output file: [insert $report_path from above]

**MANDATORY VERIFICATION**: After agent returns:

```bash
ls -la "$report_path"
[ -f "$report_path" ] || echo "ERROR: File missing"
```

**WAIT FOR**: Agent to return REPORT_CREATED: $report_path
```

#### Anti-Pattern (Documentation-Only)

```markdown
❌ INCORRECT - Do not use this pattern:

The research phase invokes agents:

```yaml
Task {
  subagent_type: "general-purpose"
  description: "Research ${TOPIC}"
  prompt: "..."
}
```
```

**Problem**: Code fence wrapper prevents execution (0% delegation rate).

**Fix**: Remove code fences, add `**EXECUTE NOW**` directives. See [Behavioral Injection Pattern](../concepts/patterns/behavioral-injection.md).

### Troubleshooting Quick Checks

#### 1. Command Starts?

```bash
/command-name "test" 2>&1 | head -20
```

**Look for**: Library sourcing errors, function verification failures

**Fix**: Check `.claude/lib/` exists, verify SCRIPT_DIR

#### 2. Agents Delegating?

```bash
/command-name "test" 2>&1 | grep "PROGRESS:"
```

**Look for**: PROGRESS: markers (indicates agent execution)

**Fix**: Run `.claude/lib/validate-agent-invocation-pattern.sh`

#### 3. Files Created?

```bash
find .claude/specs -name "*.md" -mmin -5
ls .claude/TODO*.md 2>/dev/null
```

**Look for**: Files in `specs/NNN_topic/`, NO TODO files

**Fix**: Add MANDATORY VERIFICATION checkpoints

#### 4. Validation Passing?

```bash
./.claude/tests/test_orchestration_commands.sh
```

**Look for**: All 12 tests passing (0 failures)

**Fix**: See error messages for specific issues

### Common Problems & Solutions

#### Problem: 0% Delegation Rate

**Symptoms**:
- No PROGRESS: markers
- Output in TODO1.md files
- No reports created

**Diagnosis**:
```bash
./.claude/lib/validate-agent-invocation-pattern.sh .claude/commands/command-name.md
```

**Solution**: Remove code fences around Task invocations, add `**EXECUTE NOW**` directives

**Details**: See [Agent Delegation Troubleshooting](../troubleshooting/agent-delegation-troubleshooting.md)

#### Problem: Bootstrap Failure

**Symptoms**:
- Command exits immediately
- "Failed to source" errors

**Diagnosis**:
```bash
ls -la .claude/lib/
source .claude/lib/library-name.sh
```

**Solution**: Verify library files exist and are readable

  3. Default to project root specs/ if none found
- **Report Location**: Create report in [SPECS_DIR]/reports/[TOPIC_SLUG]/NNN_report_name.md
- **Include in Metadata**: Add "Specs Directory" field to report metadata

## Research Requirements

[SPECIFIC_REQUIREMENTS - Agent should investigate these areas:]

### For "existing_patterns" Topics:
- Search codebase for related implementations using Grep/Glob
- Read relevant source files to understand current patterns
- Identify architectural decisions and design patterns used
- Document file locations with line number references
- Note any inconsistencies or technical debt

### For "best_practices" Topics:
- Use WebSearch to find 2025-current best practices
- Focus on authoritative sources (official docs, security guides)
- Compare industry standards with current implementation
- Identify gaps between best practices and current state
- Recommend specific improvements

### For "alternatives" Topics:
- Research 2-3 alternative implementation approaches
- Document pros/cons of each alternative
- Consider trade-offs (performance, complexity, maintainability)
- Recommend which alternative best fits this project
- Provide concrete examples from similar projects

### For "constraints" Topics:
- Identify technical limitations (platform, dependencies, performance)
- Document security considerations and requirements
- Note compatibility requirements (backwards compatibility, API contracts)
- Consider resource constraints (time, team expertise, infrastructure)
- Flag high-risk areas requiring careful design

## Report File Creation

3. **Document Changes**: Add comments for complex logic
4. **Verify Success**: Ensure all phase tasks are completed

## Testing

After completing implementation, run these tests:

```bash
[TEST_COMMANDS from phase]
```

All tests must pass before marking phase complete.

## Standards Compliance

Before completing, verify:
- [ ] Code style matches project standards (indentation, naming)
- [ ] Error handling follows project patterns

### Verification Checkpoint Pattern

Use this pattern after every agent invocation to ensure artifacts were created.

**Template**:

```markdown
**MANDATORY VERIFICATION**: Verify artifact creation

```bash
# Check if artifact exists
if [ ! -f "[ARTIFACT_PATH]" ]; then
  echo "ERROR: Artifact not found at expected path: [ARTIFACT_PATH]"
  echo "Searching for artifact..."

  # Search for artifact by name pattern
  FOUND_PATH=$(find specs -name "[ARTIFACT_NAME_PATTERN]" -type f -mmin -5 | head -1)

  if [ -n "$FOUND_PATH" ]; then
    echo "RECOVERED: Found artifact at: $FOUND_PATH"
    echo "Moving to expected location..."
    mkdir -p "$(dirname '[ARTIFACT_PATH]')"
    mv "$FOUND_PATH" "[ARTIFACT_PATH]"
    echo "VERIFICATION: Artifact recovered and relocated"
  else
    echo "FATAL: Artifact not found anywhere. Agent may have failed."
    exit 1
  fi
else
  echo "VERIFICATION: Artifact found at expected path"
  ls -lh "[ARTIFACT_PATH]"
fi
```
```

## Section 4: Performance Metrics

### Context Budget Management

All orchestration commands target <30% total context usage through aggressive optimization:

| Phase | Before Optimization | After Optimization | Reduction |
|-------|---------------------|-------------------|-----------|
| Phase 0: Location Detection | ~12,000 tokens | ~1,800 tokens | 85% |
| Phase 1: Research | ~20,000 tokens | ~2,000 tokens | 90% |
| Phase 2: Planning | ~15,000 tokens | ~1,500 tokens | 90% |
| Phase 3: Implementation | ~25,000 tokens | ~8,000 tokens | 68% |
| Phase 4: Testing | ~5,000 tokens | ~1,000 tokens | 80% |
| Phase 5: Debugging | ~10,000 tokens | ~2,000 tokens | 80% |
| Phase 6: Documentation | ~8,000 tokens | ~1,500 tokens | 81% |
| **Total** | **~95,000 tokens** | **~17,800 tokens** | **81%** |

**Target**: 21% context usage (42k/200k tokens) for complete 7-phase workflow

**Achieved**: Consistently <30% across all commands

### Time Savings

#### Sequential vs Parallel Execution

| Workflow Type | Sequential (/supervise) | Parallel (/coordinate) | Time Savings |
|---------------|------------------------|------------------------|--------------|
| 3 research topics | 12 minutes | 5 minutes | 58% |
| 5-phase plan | 25 minutes | 12 minutes | 52% |
| 8-phase implementation | 45 minutes | 20 minutes | 56% |
| Full workflow (7 phases) | 60 minutes | 25 minutes | 58% |

**Average Savings**: 40-60% with wave-based parallel execution

#### Phase 0 Optimization Impact

**Before** (agent-based location detection):
- Time: 180 seconds per workflow
- Tokens: ~12,000 tokens
- Reliability: 90% (fallback to TODO files)

**After** (unified library detection):
- Time: 7 seconds per workflow
- Tokens: ~1,800 tokens
- Reliability: 100% (fail-fast)

**Improvement**: 25x faster, 85% token reduction, 100% reliability

### Delegation Metrics

All orchestration commands achieve >90% delegation rate through [Behavioral Injection Pattern](../concepts/patterns/behavioral-injection.md):

| Command | Delegation Rate | File Creation | Context Usage |
|---------|----------------|---------------|---------------|
| /research | 95% | 100% | <25% |
| /supervise | 92% | 100% | <28% |
| /coordinate | 93% | 100% | <27% |
| /orchestrate | 91% | 100% | <30% |

**Validation**: Run `.claude/tests/test_orchestration_commands.sh` for automated metrics verification

### Complexity Thresholds

Orchestration commands use these thresholds for adaptive planning:

| Metric | Threshold | Action |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| Phase Complexity Score | >8.0 | Auto-expand to separate file |
| Task Count | >10 | Auto-expand regardless of score |
| File References | >10 | Increase complexity score |
| Replan Limit | 2 | Maximum replans per phase |

**Configuration**: See [Adaptive Planning Configuration](../../CLAUDE.md#adaptive_planning_config)

### Benchmark Results

Measured on Spec 508 (Coordinate Command Improvements):

| Metric | Value | Target | Status |
|--------|-------|--------|--------|
| Total Time | 28 minutes | <60 min | ✓ PASS |
| Context Peak | 58k tokens | <100k | ✓ PASS |
| Context Average | 42k tokens | <60k | ✓ PASS |
| Delegation Rate | 94% | >90% | ✓ PASS |
| File Creation | 12/12 (100%) | 100% | ✓ PASS |
| Test Pass Rate | 100% | 100% | ✓ PASS |

## Section 5: Alternative Patterns

### Sequential vs Parallel Research

#### Sequential Pattern (/supervise)

**When to Use**:
- Research topics have dependencies
- Learning orchestration system
- Debugging research issues

**Pattern**:
```bash
# Topic 1
Task { research existing_patterns }
WAIT for completion
Extract metadata from report_1

# Topic 2 (depends on Topic 1)
Task { research best_practices }
WAIT for completion
Extract metadata from report_2

# Topic 3 (depends on Topic 2)
Task { research implementation_approach }
WAIT for completion
Extract metadata from report_3
```

**Time**: ~12 minutes for 3 topics (4 min each)

#### Parallel Pattern (/coordinate, /orchestrate)

**When to Use**:
- Research topics are independent
- Speed is priority
- Production workflows

**Pattern**:
```bash
# Calculate all paths first
REPORT_PATH_1=$(create_topic_artifact "$topic" "reports" "existing_patterns")
REPORT_PATH_2=$(create_topic_artifact "$topic" "reports" "best_practices")
REPORT_PATH_3=$(create_topic_artifact "$topic" "reports" "implementation")

# Invoke all agents in parallel
Task { research existing_patterns } &
Task { research best_practices } &
Task { research implementation_approach } &

# Wait for all to complete
WAIT for all agents

# Extract metadata from all reports
extract_report_metadata "$REPORT_PATH_1"
extract_report_metadata "$REPORT_PATH_2"
extract_report_metadata "$REPORT_PATH_3"
```

**Time**: ~5 minutes for 3 topics (worst case 4 min + overhead)

**Savings**: 58% time reduction

### Wave-Based Implementation

#### Traditional Sequential

**Pattern**:
```bash
for phase in {1..8}; do
  implement_phase $phase
  run_tests
  commit_changes
done
```

**Problem**: No parallelization, even for independent phases

**Time**: 8 phases × 5 min = 40 minutes

#### Wave-Based Parallel

**Pattern**:
```bash
# Analyze dependencies
parse_dependencies plan.md > dependency_graph.json

# Group into waves
# Wave 1: Phases with no dependencies [1, 2, 3]
# Wave 2: Phases depending only on Wave 1 [4, 5]
# Wave 3: Phases depending on Wave 2 [6, 7, 8]

# Execute waves
for wave in {1..3}; do
  for phase in $(get_wave_phases $wave); do
    Task { implement_phase $phase } &
  done
  wait  # Wait for all phases in wave to complete
done
```

**Benefit**: 40-60% time savings for plans with independent phases

**Time**: 3 waves × 7 min = 21 minutes (48% savings)

### Agent-Based vs Library-Based Location Detection

#### Agent-Based (Deprecated)

**Pattern**:
```bash
Task {
  prompt: "Detect specs directory location using filesystem search"
  subagent_type: "general-purpose"
}
WAIT for agent
SPECS_DIR=$(extract from agent output)
```

**Problems**:
- 180 seconds execution time
- 12,000 tokens consumed
- 10% fallback rate to TODO files
- Difficult to debug

**Status**: Deprecated in Spec 508

#### Library-Based (Current)

**Pattern**:
```bash
source .claude/lib/unified-location-detection.sh
detect_workflow_scope "$USER_WORKFLOW"
SPECS_DIR="$WORKFLOW_SPECS_DIR"
```

**Benefits**:
- 7 seconds execution time (25x faster)
- 1,800 tokens consumed (85% reduction)
- 100% reliability (fail-fast on errors)
- Easy to debug bash functions

**Status**: Current standard (Spec 508+)

### Metadata Extraction vs Full Content Loading

#### Full Content Loading (Anti-Pattern)

```bash
# ❌ INCORRECT
REPORT_CONTENT=$(cat "$REPORT_PATH")  # 5,000 tokens
PLAN_CONTENT=$(cat "$PLAN_PATH")      # 8,000 tokens

# Pass full content to next phase
Task {
  prompt: "
    Report: $REPORT_CONTENT
    Plan: $PLAN_CONTENT
    Implement...
  "
}
```

**Problem**: Massive context consumption (13,000 tokens for 2 files)

#### Metadata Extraction (Best Practice)

```bash
# ✓ CORRECT
source .claude/lib/metadata-extraction.sh

REPORT_META=$(extract_report_metadata "$REPORT_PATH")  # 250 tokens
PLAN_META=$(extract_plan_metadata "$PLAN_PATH")        # 300 tokens

# Pass metadata only
Task {
  prompt: "
    Report: $(echo "$REPORT_META" | jq -r '.summary')
    Plan: $(echo "$PLAN_META" | jq -r '.summary')
    Full content available at: $REPORT_PATH, $PLAN_PATH
    Implement...
  "
}
```

**Benefit**: 96% context reduction (13,000 → 550 tokens)
