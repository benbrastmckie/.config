# ARCHIVED: /supervise Phase Reference

**This file has been consolidated into [Workflow Phases Documentation](workflow-phases.md).**

## New Location

The content from this file has been integrated into:
**[Workflow Phases Documentation - /supervise Specific Phase Reference](workflow-phases.md#supervise-specific-phase-reference)**

The `/supervise` specific phase documentation (Phase 0-6) is now a subsection of the unified Workflow Phases Documentation, making it easier to compare with the general orchestration workflow phases (Research, Planning, Implementation, Documentation).

## What's Included

The consolidated section includes:
- Phase Overview (0-6 phase table)
- Phase 0: Location and Path Pre-Calculation
- Phase 1: Research (/supervise)
- Phase 2: Planning (/supervise)
- Phase 3: Implementation (/supervise)
- Phase 4: Testing (/supervise)
- Phase 5: Debug (/supervise)
- Phase 6: Documentation (/supervise)
- /supervise Phase Comparison with /orchestrate

## Reason for Consolidation

Having `/supervise` phases in a separate file created unnecessary fragmentation. The consolidated structure provides better context by showing how `/supervise`'s 7-phase workflow (0-6) maps to the general 4-phase orchestration workflow (Research, Planning, Implementation, Documentation).
