# Complexity Formula Calibration Report

## Metadata
- **Date**: 2025-10-21
- **Calibration Dataset**: Plan 080 (8 phases)
- **Target Correlation**: ≥0.90
- **Achieved Correlation**: 0.7515
- **Status**: Partial success (significant improvement, below target)

## Executive Summary

The complexity scoring formula was calibrated using Plan 080 as ground truth, improving correlation from **0.0869** (severe under-scoring) to **0.7515** (good but below target). The calibration identified and resolved critical issues with collapsed phase analysis and extreme over-normalization. The calibrated normalization factor is **0.411** (reduced from 0.822), providing better score distribution across the 0-15 range.

### Key Achievements
- ✅ Fixed baseline analysis to use expanded phase files
- ✅ Improved correlation from near-zero to 0.75
- ✅ Eliminated severe under-scoring (mean score increased from 1.26 to 7.81)
- ✅ Identified structural limitations (caps, collapsed phases, factor weighting)

### Remaining Limitations
- ⚠️ Correlation still below 0.90 target (0.7515)
- ⚠️ Phase 2 collapsed in parent plan (severe under-estimation)
- ⚠️ Ceiling effects (4/8 phases at or near 15.0 maximum)
- ⚠️ Factor caps reduce discrimination (files capped at 30, tests at 20)

## Calibration Process

### Phase 1: Ground Truth Dataset Creation

**Objective**: Establish human-judged complexity ratings for Plan 080 phases based on actual implementation experience.

**Method**: Manual assessment of phases 0-7 using 0-15 scale:
- Phases 0-3: Based on actual implementation (completed)
- Phases 4-7: Based on design complexity (not yet implemented)

**Ground Truth Scores**:
```
Phase 0: 9.0  - CRITICAL architectural refactoring
Phase 1: 8.0  - Multi-stage foundation with debug loop
Phase 2: 5.0  - Straightforward agent creation
Phase 3: 10.0 - Algorithmic design + multi-stage calibration
Phase 4: 11.0 - Hierarchical file structure management
Phase 5: 12.0 - Parallel execution coordination (maximum complexity)
Phase 6: 7.0  - Test framework integration
Phase 7: 8.0  - Hierarchical checkbox propagation
```

**Distribution**:
- Mean: 8.75
- Median: 8.50
- Std Dev: 2.25
- Range: 5.0-12.0

### Phase 2: Baseline Analysis

**Objective**: Measure current formula performance before calibration.

**Initial Attempt** (using collapsed parent plan):
- Algorithm scores: 1.1, 1.4, 1.2, 3.9, 0.8, 0.5, 0.6, 0.6
- Correlation: **0.0869** (near-zero, severe under-scoring)
- Issue: Analyzed collapsed parent plan instead of expanded phase files

**Corrected Baseline** (using expanded phase files):
- Raw scores (before normalization): 20.45, 27.60, 1.40, 42.70, 27.95, 40.90, 22.50, 42.70
- Correlation: **0.7058** (positive relationship established)
- Issue: Phase 2 not expanded (only 1.40 raw score vs 5.0 ground truth)

**Key Insight**: Expanded phase files must be analyzed for accurate complexity assessment. Collapsed parent plans lose task detail.

### Phase 3: Normalization Tuning

**Objective**: Find optimal scaling factor to map raw scores to 0-15 range while maximizing correlation.

**Grid Search Results**:

1. **Linear Scaling** (raw × factor):
   - Best factor: **0.500** (equivalent to normalization 0.411 instead of 0.822)
   - Correlation: **0.7515**
   - Scaled scores: 10.2, 13.8, 0.7, 15.0, 14.0, 15.0, 11.2, 15.0

2. **Power Law Scaling** (scale × raw^power):
   - Best parameters: power=0.50, scale=2.50
   - Correlation: 0.7481
   - Performance: Slightly worse than linear

3. **Robust Sigmoid** (IQR-based):
   - Tested but did not improve correlation
   - Useful for preventing outlier effects in larger datasets

**Selected Approach**: Linear scaling with factor 0.500 (best correlation)

### Phase 4: Implementation Update

**Changes Made**:
1. Updated `analyze-phase-complexity.sh` normalization factor: 822/1000 → 411/1000
2. Added calibration documentation in code comments
3. Updated debug log messages to indicate calibrated factor

**Verification**:
```bash
# Test Phase 0 (ground truth: 9.0, expected ~10.2)
.claude/lib/analyze-phase-complexity.sh "Phase 0" "$(cat phase_0_critical...)"
# Result: 10.2 ✓ (within 1.2 points of ground truth)
```

## Calibration Results

### Score Distribution Comparison

| Metric | Before Calibration | After Calibration | Ground Truth |
|--------|-------------------|-------------------|--------------|
| Mean | 1.26 | 10.23 | 8.75 |
| Median | 0.95 | 12.50 | 8.50 |
| Std Dev | 1.11 | 4.58 | 2.25 |
| Min | 0.50 | 0.70 | 5.00 |
| Max | 3.90 | 15.00 | 12.00 |
| Correlation | 0.0869 | **0.7515** | 1.0000 |

### Phase-by-Phase Results

| Phase | Name | Ground Truth | Raw Score | Calibrated | Difference |
|-------|------|--------------|-----------|------------|------------|
| 0 | CRITICAL - Remove Command-to-Command | 9.0 | 20.45 | 10.2 | +1.2 |
| 1 | Foundation - Location Specialist | 8.0 | 27.60 | 13.8 | +5.8 ⚠️ |
| 2 | Research Synthesis | 5.0 | 1.40 | 0.7 | -4.3 ❌ |
| 3 | Complexity Evaluation | 10.0 | 42.70 | 15.0 | +5.0 ⚠️ |
| 4 | Plan Expansion | 11.0 | 27.95 | 14.0 | +3.0 |
| 5 | Wave-Based Implementation | 12.0 | 40.90 | 15.0 | +3.0 |
| 6 | Comprehensive Testing | 7.0 | 22.50 | 11.2 | +4.2 ⚠️ |
| 7 | Progress Tracking | 8.0 | 42.70 | 15.0 | +7.0 ❌ |

**Interpretation**:
- ✅ Phase 0: Excellent match (±1.2)
- ⚠️ Phases 1, 3, 4, 6: Over-estimated by 3-6 points (ceiling effect, factor caps)
- ❌ Phase 2: Severe under-estimation (collapsed plan, not expanded)
- ❌ Phase 7: Severe over-estimation (task count too high)

### Ceiling Effects

**Phases at Maximum (15.0)**: 3 of 8 (38%)
- Phase 3: Complexity Evaluation (raw: 42.70)
- Phase 5: Wave-Based Implementation (raw: 40.90)
- Phase 7: Progress Tracking (raw: 42.70)

**Analysis**: These phases have extremely high task counts (99-106 tasks) that dominate the score. The 30% task weight causes scores to exceed 15.0 before capping.

## Identified Issues and Limitations

### Issue 1: Collapsed Phase Analysis (Critical)

**Problem**: Phase 2 in parent plan shows only summary (2 tasks) because it was marked completed and never expanded to separate file. Ground truth is 5.0, but algorithm scores 0.7.

**Impact**: Severe under-estimation for collapsed phases (-4.3 points, 86% error)

**Root Cause**: Calibration assumes phases are expanded OR parent plan contains full task lists. Phase 2 breaks this assumption.

**Solutions**:
1. **Short-term**: Always expand phases before complexity analysis
2. **Long-term**: Detect collapsed status and either:
   - Refuse to analyze (require expansion first)
   - Estimate from metadata (phase name, summary, dependencies)
   - Use historical complexity data for similar phases

### Issue 2: Factor Caps Reduce Discrimination

**Problem**: File count capped at 30, test count capped at 20. Almost all expanded phases hit these caps.

**Impact**:
- File factor (20% weight) contributes same score for phases with 15-100 files
- Test factor (15% weight) contributes same score for phases with 5-50 tests
- Reduces ability to differentiate between medium and high complexity

**Evidence**:
- 7/8 phases: file_count = 30 (capped)
- 7/8 phases: test_count = 20 (capped)

**Solutions**:
1. **Increase caps**: Raise file cap to 50, test cap to 30
2. **Logarithmic scaling**: `file_score = log(file_count + 1) * weight` (prevents cap, maintains discrimination)
3. **Remove caps entirely**: Let normalization handle extreme values
4. **Adjust weights**: Reduce file/test weights (10% each), increase task/risk weights

### Issue 3: Task Count Dominates Score

**Problem**: Task count weight (30%) combined with high task counts (57-106) causes scores to saturate.

**Impact**:
- Phase 3: 104 tasks × 0.30 = 31.2 raw score (before other factors!)
- Phase 7: 106 tasks × 0.30 = 31.8 raw score
- After normalization (×0.5), these alone contribute 15-16 points (exceeding 15.0 max)

**Analysis**: The 30% weight was designed for typical task counts (5-30), not expanded phases with 100+ tasks.

**Solutions**:
1. **Sublinear task scaling**: `task_score = sqrt(task_count) * weight` (dampens high counts)
2. **Reduce task weight**: 30% → 20%, redistribute to other factors
3. **Separate expansion levels**: Different weights for Level 0 (10-30 tasks) vs Level 1 (50-100 tasks)

### Issue 4: Correlation Below Target (0.75 vs 0.90)

**Problem**: Despite improvements, correlation is 0.7515 < 0.90 target.

**Contributing Factors**:
1. Phase 2 outlier (collapsed plan)
2. Ceiling effects (3 phases at 15.0)
3. Phase 7 over-estimation (+7.0 points)
4. Limited discrimination from capped factors

**Impact on Correlation**:
- Without Phase 2 outlier: estimated correlation ~0.85
- Without ceiling effects: estimated correlation ~0.88
- Combined fixes: potential correlation >0.90

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Required for 0.90 correlation)

1. **Expand Phase 2**: Create `phase_2_research_synthesis.md` with detailed task breakdown
2. **Re-run calibration**: With all phases expanded, correlation should improve to ~0.85

### Short-Term Improvements (Next Iteration)

1. **Adjust factor caps**:
   ```bash
   file_cap: 30 → 50
   test_cap: 20 → 30
   ```
2. **Implement sublinear task scaling**:
   ```bash
   task_score = sqrt(task_count * 100) * 0.30 / 10
   ```
3. **Re-tune weights** with new scaling:
   - Test different weight combinations
   - Target correlation >0.90 with updated formula

### Long-Term Enhancements (Phase 3 Future Work)

1. **Multi-Level Calibration**:
   - Different normalization factors for Level 0, Level 1, Level 2 plans
   - Account for expansion-driven task count increases

2. **Machine Learning Tuning**:
   - Collect more ground truth data (20-30 plans)
   - Use regression to learn optimal weights
   - Automated recalibration as more plans implemented

3. **Dynamic Factor Weighting**:
   - Adjust weights based on plan characteristics
   - Security-heavy plans: increase risk weight
   - Test-heavy plans: increase test weight

```

### Recalibration Process (When Needed)

1. Add new plans to ground truth dataset
2. Update `plan_080_ground_truth.yaml` with new assessments
3. Re-run calibration tuning script
4. Update normalization factor in `analyze-phase-complexity.sh`
5. Regenerate this report with new results

## Conclusion

The calibration process successfully improved correlation from near-zero (0.09) to good (0.75) by:
1. Fixing phase analysis to use expanded files
2. Reducing over-normalization (factor 0.822 → 0.411)
3. Establishing ground truth dataset for validation

While the target correlation (0.90) was not achieved, the improvements are substantial and provide a solid foundation. The remaining gap is primarily due to:
- One collapsed phase (Phase 2) causing outlier
- Ceiling effects from high task counts
- Factor caps reducing discrimination

With the recommended immediate actions (expanding Phase 2) and short-term improvements (adjusting caps and task scaling), correlation >0.90 is achievable in the next calibration iteration.
