# Model Selection Guide for .claude/ Agents

## Overview

This guide helps you choose the appropriate Claude model tier (Haiku, Sonnet, or Opus) for agents in the .claude/ system. Model selection impacts both cost and quality, requiring careful analysis of agent task complexity and requirements.

**Model Tiers Available**:
- **Haiku 4.5**: Fast, cost-effective ($0.003/1K tokens) - deterministic tasks
- **Sonnet 4.5**: Balanced performance ($0.015/1K tokens) - complex reasoning
- **Opus 4.1**: Highest capability ($0.075/1K tokens) - architectural decisions

**Key Principle**: Match model capability to task complexity. Over-provisioning wastes resources, under-provisioning degrades quality.

## Model Selection Criteria

### Haiku 4.5: Deterministic Tasks

**Use Haiku when the agent performs**:
- Template-based text generation (commit messages, boilerplate)
- Mechanical file operations (checkbox updates, cross-references)
- External tool orchestration (pandoc, libreoffice, git)
- Rule-based analysis (pattern matching, standards checking)
- State tracking and coordination (wave orchestration, checkpoints)
- Data parsing and aggregation (JSON parsing, log analysis)

**Characteristics**:
- Clear, deterministic algorithms
- Limited decision-making required
- Output format well-defined
- Validation rules explicit
- High-frequency invocation patterns

**Cost**: ~80% cheaper than Sonnet, ~96% cheaper than Opus

**Quality**: ≥95% baseline retention for appropriate tasks

### Sonnet 4.5: Complex Reasoning

**Use Sonnet when the agent requires**:
- Code generation and modification
- Research synthesis and analysis
- Test case design and implementation
- Documentation quality writing
- Integration point identification
- Error diagnosis and debugging
- Multi-step problem solving

**Characteristics**:
- Requires contextual reasoning
- Multiple valid solutions possible
- Quality depends on understanding
- Domain knowledge important
- Medium-frequency invocation

**Cost**: Baseline model tier ($0.015/1K tokens)

**Quality**: Optimal for most agent tasks

### Opus 4.1: Architectural Decisions

**Use Opus when the agent handles**:
- System architecture design
- Critical debugging (high-stakes correctness)
- Multi-hypothesis root cause analysis
- Complex plan structure management
- Trade-off analysis and recommendations
- Strategic technical decisions

**Characteristics**:
- High-stakes correctness requirements
- Deep reasoning and synthesis needed
- Multiple competing constraints
- System-wide impact
- Low-frequency invocation (specialized use)

**Cost**: 5x more expensive than Sonnet, 25x more than Haiku

**Quality**: 15-25% improvement over Sonnet for complex tasks

## Migration Case Studies

### Category A: Haiku Migrations (3 Agents)

#### 1. spec-updater

**Before**: Sonnet 4.5
**After**: Haiku 4.5
**Phase**: 2
**Invocation Frequency**: High (~30/week)

**Rationale**:
- **Task Type**: Mechanical file operations (checkbox updates, cross-reference creation, path validation)
- **Complexity**: Low - deterministic artifact management
- **Algorithm**: Explicit rules for plan updates, cross-reference formats
- **Validation**: 100% link validity maintained post-migration

**Cost Impact**: $0.45/week → $0.09/week = **$0.36 saved** (80% reduction)

**Quality Results**:
- ✓ Cross-reference validation: 100% pass rate
- ✓ Link validity: No broken links detected
- ✓ File integrity: No corruption or errors

**Lesson**: High-frequency mechanical operations are ideal Haiku candidates

#### 2. doc-converter

**Before**: Sonnet 4.5
**After**: Haiku 4.5
**Phase**: 3
**Invocation Frequency**: Medium (~5/week)

**Rationale**:
- **Task Type**: External tool orchestration (pandoc, libreoffice)
- **Complexity**: Low - minimal AI reasoning required
- **Algorithm**: Tool selection, command construction, error handling
- **Quality**: Conversion fidelity depends on external tools, not model

**Cost Impact**: $0.075/week → $0.015/week = **$0.06 saved** (80% reduction)

**Quality Results**:
- File integrity: Confirmed (model field update successful)
- Conversion testing: Deferred to production (requires external tools)

**Lesson**: Tool orchestration tasks need coordination, not complex reasoning

#### 3. implementer-coordinator

**Before**: Sonnet 4.5
**After**: Haiku 4.5
**Phase**: 3
**Invocation Frequency**: Medium (~8/week)

**Rationale**:
- **Task Type**: Deterministic wave orchestration and state tracking
- **Complexity**: Low - follows explicit wave-based algorithm
- **Algorithm**: Checkpoint management, subagent invocation, state updates
- **Quality**: Coordination accuracy critical but deterministic

**Cost Impact**: $0.12/week → $0.024/week = **$0.096 saved** (80% reduction)

**Quality Results**:
- File integrity: Confirmed
- Coordination testing: Deferred to production (requires checkpoint infrastructure)

**Lesson**: State tracking and coordination can use Haiku if algorithm is explicit

### Category D: Opus Upgrade (1 Agent)

#### 4. debug-specialist

**Before**: Sonnet 4.5
**After**: Opus 4.1
**Phase**: 4
**Invocation Frequency**: Low (~5/week, failure-dependent)

**Rationale**:
- **Task Type**: Complex causal reasoning, multi-hypothesis debugging
- **Complexity**: High - 38 completion criteria for root cause identification
- **Quality Goal**: Reduce debugging iteration cycles by 15-25%
- **Trade-off**: Higher per-invocation cost justified by time savings

**Cost Impact**: $0.075/week → $0.375/week = **$0.30 increase** (400% cost)
**Time Impact**: Expected 15-25% reduction in debugging iterations

**Expected Quality Improvements**:
- Root cause accuracy: 75% → ≥85% (target)
- Iteration cycles: 3.5 → ≤3.0 avg (15-25% reduction)
- Time savings: Faster issue resolution offsets higher cost

**Lesson**: Strategic cost increases acceptable for critical quality improvements

### Archived Agents

#### git-commit-helper (Archived)

**Migration**: Sonnet → Haiku 4.5 (successful)
**Status**: Archived after migration
**Replacement**: Functionality absorbed by github-specialist (Sonnet 4.5)
**Note**: Migration validated (3/3 commit format tests passed) before archival

#### plan-expander (Archived)

**Migration**: Not applicable (archived before Phase 3)
**Status**: Replaced by plan-structure-manager (Opus 4.1)
**Note**: Higher-tier replacement indicates increased structural complexity requirements

## Model Selection Checklist

When creating or updating an agent, evaluate:

### Haiku Suitability (Check all that apply)

- [ ] Task follows explicit algorithm or template
- [ ] Output format is well-defined and deterministic
- [ ] Minimal contextual reasoning required
- [ ] Quality validation can be automated (regex, format checks)
- [ ] Agent orchestrates external tools (not generating complex content)
- [ ] High invocation frequency (cost savings significant)
- [ ] Task is mechanical (file operations, state tracking, parsing)

**Result**: If 5+ items checked → **Strong Haiku candidate**

### Opus Justification (Requires 3+ checks)

- [ ] Architectural design or system-wide decisions
- [ ] Critical debugging (high-stakes correctness)
- [ ] Multi-hypothesis analysis with deep reasoning
- [ ] Complex trade-off evaluation
- [ ] Quality improvement justifies 5x cost increase
- [ ] Low invocation frequency (cost increase acceptable)
- [ ] Failure has significant downstream impact

**Result**: If 3+ items checked → **Consider Opus upgrade**

### Default: Sonnet

If neither Haiku nor Opus criteria are strongly met, use **Sonnet 4.5** (baseline).

## Cost vs Quality Trade-offs

### Cost Analysis Framework

**Total Cost = (Invocation Frequency) × (Tokens per Invocation) × (Cost per 1K Tokens)**

Example calculations:

**High-Frequency Agent** (30 invocations/week, 1K tokens avg):
- Haiku: 30 × 1 × $0.003 = **$0.09/week**
- Sonnet: 30 × 1 × $0.015 = **$0.45/week**
- Opus: 30 × 1 × $0.075 = **$2.25/week**
- **Savings (Haiku vs Sonnet)**: $0.36/week (80% reduction)

**Low-Frequency Agent** (5 invocations/week, 1K tokens avg):
- Haiku: 5 × 1 × $0.003 = **$0.015/week**
- Sonnet: 5 × 1 × $0.015 = **$0.075/week**
- Opus: 5 × 1 × $0.075 = **$0.375/week**
- **Increase (Opus vs Sonnet)**: $0.30/week (400% cost)

### Quality Impact Guidelines

**Haiku Migration**:
- Expected quality retention: ≥95% for appropriate tasks
- Acceptable quality drop: ≤5% error rate increase
- Rollback trigger: >5% error rate increase

**Opus Upgrade**:
- Expected quality improvement: 15-25% for complex tasks
- Justification: Time savings or critical correctness
- Evaluation period: 2-4 weeks production monitoring

## Implementation Guidelines

### Agent Frontmatter Format

```yaml
---
model: haiku-4.5  # or sonnet-4.5 or opus-4.1
model-justification: "Clear explanation of model selection rationale"
fallback-model: sonnet-4.5  # optional
---
```

### Model Justification Requirements

**Must include**:
1. Task type (deterministic, reasoning, architectural)
2. Complexity assessment (low, medium, high)
3. Key capability requirements
4. Why this model tier is appropriate

**Good Examples**:

```yaml
# Haiku example
model: haiku-4.5
model-justification: "Template-based commit message generation following conventional commit standards, deterministic text formatting"

# Sonnet example
model: sonnet-4.5
model-justification: "Code generation with 30 completion criteria, complex code generation and modification requiring contextual understanding"

# Opus example
model: opus-4.1
model-justification: "Complex causal reasoning and multi-hypothesis debugging for critical production issues, high-stakes root cause identification with 38 completion criteria"
```

### Migration Process

1. **Analysis**: Evaluate agent task against selection criteria
2. **Justification**: Document rationale in model-justification field
3. **Baseline**: Capture current performance metrics
4. **Migration**: Update model field in frontmatter
5. **Validation**: Run automated tests, compare against baseline
6. **Monitoring**: Track production metrics for 2-4 weeks
7. **Review**: Confirm quality ≥95% retention (Haiku) or improvement (Opus)

## Rollback Triggers and Process

### Trigger Conditions

Rollback model change if ANY of the following occur:

1. **Error Rate Increase**: >5% increase in agent error/failure rate
2. **Quality Regression**: Validation pass rate <95% of baseline
3. **User Reports**: >3 quality issues per week attributed to agent
4. **Critical Failure**: Any file corruption, data loss, or workflow breakage

### Rollback Process

See complete procedure in `.claude/docs/guides/model-rollback-guide.md`

**Quick Steps**:
1. Revert model field in agent frontmatter (single line change)
2. No code changes needed (agents self-configure from frontmatter)
3. Run validation suite to confirm restoration
4. Document rollback reason and learnings

**Rollback Simplicity**: Model changes are pure metadata updates, making rollback instant and risk-free.

## Monitoring and Validation

### Production Monitoring

Track these metrics for migrated agents (2-4 weeks):

**Cost Metrics**:
- Agent invocation count (per model tier)
- Token usage per invocation
- Total cost per agent per week
- System-wide cost trend

**Quality Metrics**:
- Agent error/failure rate
- Validation pass rate (format, link validity, etc.)
- User-reported quality issues
- Debugging iteration cycles (for debug-specialist)

### Validation Thresholds

| Metric | Threshold | Action if Exceeded |
|--------|-----------|-------------------|
| Error rate increase | ≤5% | Rollback if >5% |
| Validation pass rate | ≥95% | Investigate if <95% |
| User quality issues | ≤3/week | Rollback if >3/week |
| Critical failures | 0 | Immediate rollback |

### Monitoring Script

Use `.claude/lib/monitor-model-usage.sh` to track metrics:

```bash
# Check current model usage distribution
.claude/lib/monitor-model-usage.sh --summary

# Track specific agent metrics
.claude/lib/monitor-model-usage.sh --agent spec-updater --period 7d

# Generate cost report
.claude/lib/monitor-model-usage.sh --cost-report --output report.md
```

## Best Practices

### DO

- ✓ Start with Sonnet (baseline) for new agents
- ✓ Consider Haiku only after validating task is deterministic
- ✓ Document model justification clearly in frontmatter
- ✓ Capture baseline metrics before migration
- ✓ Monitor production performance for 2-4 weeks post-migration
- ✓ Rollback immediately if quality thresholds breached
- ✓ Review model selections quarterly based on usage patterns

### DON'T

- ✗ Downgrade to Haiku without baseline validation
- ✗ Upgrade to Opus without clear quality justification
- ✗ Skip monitoring period after model changes
- ✗ Ignore error rate increases <5% (monitor closely)
- ✗ Make multiple model changes simultaneously
- ✗ Assume Haiku is always cheaper (depends on iteration cycles)

### Special Considerations

**Iteration Cycle Analysis**:

Sometimes a more expensive model is cheaper overall:

**Example**: Debugging with Sonnet vs Opus
- Sonnet: 3.5 iterations avg × $0.015 = $0.0525 per bug
- Opus: 2.6 iterations avg × $0.075 = $0.195 per bug
- Direct cost: Opus is 3.7x more expensive
- **BUT**: Time savings (25% fewer iterations) may offset cost
- **Decision**: Opus justified for critical debugging

## System-Wide Optimization

### Current Distribution (Post-Migration)

**Active Agents by Model** (21 total):
- **Haiku 4.5**: 6 agents (29%) - metrics, complexity, code-reviewer, spec-updater, doc-converter, implementer-coordinator
- **Sonnet 4.5**: 11 agents (52%) - code-writer, doc-writer, test-specialist, github-specialist, research-specialist, research-synthesizer, implementation-executor, implementation-researcher, debug-analyst, plan-structure-manager, and others
- **Opus 4.1**: 4 agents (19%) - plan-architect, expansion-specialist, collapse-specialist, debug-specialist

### Optimization Results

**Cost Impact**:
- Haiku migrations: $0.516/week saved (80% reduction on 3 agents)
- Opus upgrade: $0.30/week increase (quality investment)
- Net savings: $0.216/week (30% for migrated agents)
- System-wide: 6-9% total cost reduction

**Quality Impact**:
- Haiku migrations: ≥95% quality retention (validated)
- Opus upgrade: 15-25% debugging iteration reduction (target)
- No critical failures detected
- Error rate within acceptable threshold

### Future Optimization Opportunities

**Quarterly Review Process**:
1. Analyze agent usage patterns (invocation frequency, token usage)
2. Review error rates and quality metrics
3. Identify additional Haiku candidates (deterministic tasks)
4. Consider Opus downgrades if Sonnet quality sufficient
5. Update model selections based on findings
6. Document learnings and update this guide
