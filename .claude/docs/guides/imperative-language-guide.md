# ARCHIVED: Imperative Language Guide

**This file has been consolidated into [Execution Enforcement Guide](execution-enforcement-guide.md).**

## New Location

The content from this file has been integrated into:
**[Execution Enforcement Guide - Section 3: Imperative Language Rules](execution-enforcement-guide.md#imperative-language-rules)**

Specifically:
- **Why Imperative Language Matters** → Explains the problem and solution
- **Transformation Rules** → Complete table of prohibited words and replacements
- **Imperative Verbs by Requirement Level** → MUST/WILL/SHALL/MAY usage guidelines
- **Application Guidelines** → Rules for commands vs agents

## Reason for Consolidation

This file had 50% content overlap with the Execution Enforcement Guide. The imperative language rules are a core part of execution enforcement (Standard 0.5), so consolidating them provides better context and reduces duplication. The unified guide now covers both **what** to enforce (patterns) and **how** to express requirements (imperative language).
