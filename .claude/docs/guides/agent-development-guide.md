## 1. Agent Behavioral Files Overview

### What Are Agent Behavioral Files?

Agent behavioral files (`.claude/agents/*.md`) define specialized agent behavior for specific tasks:
- **research-specialist.md**: Conducts codebase research and creates reports
- **plan-architect.md**: Creates implementation plans from requirements
- **code-writer.md**: Executes code changes from task specifications
- **debug-analyst.md**: Investigates bugs and creates debug reports
- **doc-writer.md**: Creates documentation and workflow summaries

### Agent Lifecycle

1. **Command invokes agent**: Primary command uses Task tool to invoke agent
2. **Agent receives context**: Command injects behavioral prompt + task-specific context
3. **Agent executes**: Agent uses Read/Write/Edit tools to complete task
4. **Agent returns metadata**: Path + summary + key findings (NOT full content)
5. **Command processes**: Command verifies artifact and extracts metadata

### Location

- **Project agents**: `.claude/agents/` (takes priority)
- **Global agents**: `~/.config/.claude/agents/` (fallback)

### Naming Convention

- **Filename**: `agent-name.md` (lowercase, hyphens)
- **Agent Name**: Derived from filename without `.md`
- **Display Name**: Formatted in agent file header

Examples:
- `code-writer.md` ‚Üí agent name: `code-writer`
- `debug-specialist.md` ‚Üí agent name: `debug-specialist`

---

## 2. The Behavioral Injection Pattern

### Pattern Overview

The behavioral injection pattern separates concerns:
- **Commands**: Orchestration, path calculation, verification, metadata extraction
- **Agents**: Execution, artifact creation, analysis

### How It Works

```
1. Command Pre-Calculates Path
   ‚Üì
   source "${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}/.claude/lib/artifact-creation.sh"
   TOPIC_DIR=$(get_or_create_topic_dir "$FEATURE" "specs")
   ARTIFACT_PATH=$(create_topic_artifact "$TOPIC_DIR" "reports" "research" "")
   # Result: specs/042_feature/reports/042_research.md

2. Command Loads Agent Behavioral Prompt (Option A)
   ‚Üì
   source "${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}/.claude/lib/agent-loading-utils.sh"
   AGENT_PROMPT=$(load_agent_behavioral_prompt "research-specialist")

   OR Command References Agent File (Option B - Simpler)
   ‚Üì
   (Agent file referenced directly in Task prompt)

3. Command Injects Complete Context
   ‚Üì
   Task {
     subagent_type: "general-purpose"
     prompt: |
       Read and follow: .claude/agents/research-specialist.md

       **Task**: Research authentication patterns
       **Artifact Path**: $ARTIFACT_PATH
       **Success Criteria**: Create report at exact path
   }

4. Agent Creates Artifact
   ‚Üì
   (Agent uses Write tool to create file at ARTIFACT_PATH)

5. Command Verifies and Extracts Metadata
   ‚Üì
   VERIFIED=$(verify_artifact_or_recover "$ARTIFACT_PATH" "research")
   METADATA=$(extract_report_metadata "$VERIFIED")
```

### Why This Pattern?

**Benefits:**
- üìç **Path Control**: Commands control exact artifact locations
- üì¶ **Topic Organization**: All artifacts in topic-based structure
- üî¢ **Consistent Numbering**: Sequential NNN across artifact types
- üéØ **Context Reduction**: 95% reduction via metadata-only passing
- üö´ **No Recursion**: Agents never invoke commands that invoked them
- üèóÔ∏è **Architectural Consistency**: All commands follow same pattern

## 3. Agent File Structure

### File Format

```markdown
---
allowed-tools: Tool1, Tool2, Tool3
description: One-line description of agent purpose
---

# Agent Name

System prompt defining agent behavior and capabilities.

## Core Capabilities

[What this agent does]

## Standards Compliance

[Project-specific standards this agent follows]

## Behavioral Guidelines

[How this agent approaches tasks]

## Expected Input

[What information this agent needs to function effectively]

## Expected Output

[What format/structure this agent returns]
```

### Frontmatter Fields

#### allowed-tools (required)

Comma-separated list of tools the agent can use.

```yaml
allowed-tools: Read, Write, Edit, Bash, TodoWrite
```

**Common Tool Combinations**:

| Agent Type | Tools |
|-----------|-------|
| Code Writer | Read, Write, Edit, Bash, TodoWrite |
| Documentation Writer | Read, Write, Edit, Grep, Glob |
| Research | Read, Grep, Glob, WebSearch, WebFetch |
| Testing | Read, Bash, Grep, TodoWrite |
| Debugging | Read, Bash, Grep, Glob, WebSearch |

**Rationale**: These groupings ensure agents have sufficient tools for their task while maintaining security through restriction.

See [Command Architecture Standards](../reference/command_architecture_standards.md#agent-file-standards) for complete tool selection guidelines.

#### description (required)

Brief one-line description of agent's purpose.

```yaml
description: Specialized in writing and modifying code following project standards
```

**Best Practices**:
- Keep under 80 characters
- Focus on primary capability
- Mention key differentiator
- Use active voice

### System Prompt Structure

#### 1. Introduction

Clear statement of agent identity and purpose.

```markdown
# Code Writer Agent

I am a specialized agent focused on generating and modifying code according to project standards. My role is to implement features, fix bugs, and make code changes while ensuring compliance with established conventions.
```

#### 2. Core Capabilities

Detailed breakdown of what the agent does.

```markdown
## Core Capabilities

### Code Generation
- Write new modules, functions, and classes
- Create configuration files
- Generate boilerplate code following project patterns
- Implement features based on specifications

### Code Modification
- Refactor existing code for clarity or performance
- Fix bugs with targeted changes
- Update code to match new requirements
- Apply standards-compliant formatting
```

**Guidelines**:
- Use hierarchical structure (###, ####)
- List specific capabilities
- Include examples where helpful
- Be concrete, not vague

#### 3. Standards Compliance

Reference to project standards the agent must follow.

```markdown
## Standards Compliance

I follow all guidelines in CLAUDE.md:
- Lua style: 2-space indent, snake_case naming
- Documentation: README.md in every directory
- Error handling: Use pcall for operations that might fail
- Testing: Comprehensive tests for all public APIs
```

**Best Practices**:
- Reference CLAUDE.md explicitly
- List specific standards relevant to agent
- Include language-specific requirements
- Mention testing expectations

#### 4. Behavioral Guidelines

How the agent approaches tasks and makes decisions.

```markdown
## Behavioral Guidelines

### Task Management
- Break complex tasks into phases using TodoWrite
- Mark todos in_progress before starting work
- Complete todos immediately after finishing
- Keep one task in_progress at a time

### Code Quality
- Prefer editing existing files over creating new ones
- Follow DRY principle (Don't Repeat Yourself)
- Write clear, self-documenting code
- Add comments for complex logic only
```

**Guidelines**:
- Describe decision-making process
- Explain priorities and trade-offs
- Include workflow expectations
- Define quality standards

#### 5. Expected Input

What information the agent needs to function effectively.

```markdown
## Expected Input

To function effectively, I need:
- **Task Description**: Clear statement of what to implement
- **Context**: Relevant files, functions, or modules
- **Requirements**: Specific constraints or standards to follow
- **Acceptance Criteria**: How to verify success
```

**Best Practices**:
- Provide clear examples
- Specify required vs optional info
- Include format guidelines
- Show ideal input structure

#### 6. Expected Output

What format/structure the agent returns.

```markdown
## Expected Output

I will deliver:

1. **Code Changes**: Modified or new files following project standards
2. **Tests**: Comprehensive test coverage for new functionality
3. **Documentation**: Updated README files and inline documentation
4. **Summary**: Brief description of changes made

Output format:
```
Completed: [Task description]

Changes:
- Modified: auth.lua (added bcrypt hashing)
- Modified: user.lua (added User model)
- Created: auth_spec.lua (authentication tests)
- Updated: README.md (authentication docs)

Testing: All tests pass (15/15)
```
```

**Guidelines**:
- Specify deliverables clearly
- Include success indicators
- Show output format
- Mention verification steps

### Agent Output Requirements

#### Metadata Extraction Compatibility

When designing agents for multi-agent workflows, ensure outputs are compatible with metadata extraction utilities:

**For Research Agents**:
```markdown
## Executive Summary
[50-word summary of findings - REQUIRED for extract_report_metadata()]

## Key Findings
- [Finding 1 with file:line references]
- [Finding 2 with file:line references]

## Recommendations
1. [Recommendation 1]
2. [Recommendation 2]
```

**For Planning Agents**:
```markdown
## Metadata
- **Complexity**: Low/Medium/High
- **Time Estimate**: N-M hours
- **Phases**: N

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Criterion 1
- [ ] Criterion 2
```

**Why This Matters**: Structured outputs enable `extract_report_metadata()` and `forward_message()` utilities to extract metadata (path + 50-word summary) instead of passing full content between agents, achieving 95% context reduction.

See [Hierarchical Agents Guide](../concepts/hierarchical_agents.md#metadata-extraction) for complete metadata extraction patterns.

## 4. Creating a New Agent

### Step 1: Choose Agent Purpose

Identify the specific role and responsibilities.

**Questions to ask**:
- What tasks will this agent handle?
- What makes this agent different from existing agents?
- What specialized knowledge does it need?
- What tools will it require?

### Step 2: Define Agent File

Create `.claude/agents/new-agent.md`:

```markdown
---
allowed-tools: Read, Write, Edit
description: Brief description of agent purpose
---

# New Agent

System prompt content here...
```

### Step 3: Write System Prompt

Follow the structure:
1. Introduction
2. Core Capabilities
3. Standards Compliance
4. Behavioral Guidelines
5. Expected Input
6. Expected Output

### Step 4: Test the Agent

Verify it loads correctly:

```lua
local agent_registry = require('neotex.plugins.ai.claude.agent_registry')

-- Reload to pick up new agent
agent_registry.reload_registry()

-- Verify it exists
local agents = agent_registry.list_agents()
print(vim.inspect(agents))

-- Test loading
local agent = agent_registry.get_agent('new-agent')
if agent then
  print('Agent loaded successfully')
  print('Tools: ' .. table.concat(agent.allowed_tools, ', '))
else
  print('ERROR: Agent failed to load')
end
```

### Step 5: Create Test Task

Test with a simple task to verify behavior:

```lua
local task_config = agent_registry.create_task_config(
  'new-agent',
  'Simple test task',
  'Minimal context for testing'
)

print('Task config: ' .. vim.inspect(task_config))
```

---

## 5. Agent Responsibilities and Boundaries

### Agents SHOULD

‚úÖ **Create artifacts directly using Write tool**
‚úÖ **Use Read/Edit tools to analyze and modify files**
‚úÖ **Use Grep/Glob tools for codebase discovery**
‚úÖ **Return structured metadata (path, summary, findings)**
‚úÖ **Follow topic-based artifact organization**

### Agents SHOULD NOT

‚ùå **Invoke slash commands** (use SlashCommand tool for artifact creation)
‚ùå **Make assumptions about artifact paths** (use provided ARTIFACT_PATH)
‚ùå **Return full artifact content** (metadata only)
‚ùå **Create artifacts outside topic-based structure**

### Tool Usage Guidelines

#### Allowed Tools (for Agents)

**File Operations**:
- **Read**: Read file contents for analysis
- **Write**: Create new files at provided paths
- **Edit**: Modify existing files with exact string replacement

**Code Discovery**:
- **Grep**: Search file contents with regex patterns
- **Glob**: Find files matching glob patterns
- **WebSearch**: Research external documentation (when needed)

**Execution**:
- **Bash**: Run commands for testing, validation, file operations

#### Restricted Tools (for Agents)

**SlashCommand Tool**:
- **NEVER** use SlashCommand for:
  - `/plan` - Plan creation is command's responsibility
  - `/report` - Report creation is direct (not via command)
  - `/implement` - Implementation orchestration is command's responsibility
  - `/debug` - Debug workflow is command's responsibility

**Exceptions** (when SlashCommand IS allowed):
- Agent needs to delegate to another specialized command (rare)
- Explicitly instructed in behavioral file (with clear rationale)
- Example: doc-writer invoking `/list reports` to discover artifacts

### Tool Selection Decision Tree

```
Need to create artifact?
  ‚Üì
  Is ARTIFACT_PATH provided in context?
    ‚Üì YES
    Use Write tool with exact path ‚úÖ
    ‚Üì NO
    ERROR: Agent should not assume paths ‚ùå

Need to modify existing file?
  ‚Üì
  Use Edit tool with old_string/new_string ‚úÖ

Need to search codebase?
  ‚Üì
  Content search ‚Üí Grep ‚úÖ
  File search ‚Üí Glob ‚úÖ

Need to execute command?
  ‚Üì
  File operation (cp, mv, mkdir) ‚Üí Bash ‚úÖ
  Slash command (/plan, /implement) ‚Üí NEVER ‚ùå
```

## 6. Anti-Patterns and Why They're Wrong

### Anti-Pattern 1: Agent Invokes Slash Command

**WRONG:**
```markdown
# plan-architect.md

## Step 1: Create Implementation Plan

**CRITICAL**: You MUST use the SlashCommand tool to invoke /plan:

SlashCommand {
  command: "/plan ${FEATURE_DESCRIPTION}"
}
```

**Why It's Wrong:**
- ‚ùå Loss of path control (can't pre-calculate artifact location)
- ‚ùå Cannot extract metadata before context bloat
- ‚ùå Breaks topic-based organization (slash command may use different structure)
- ‚ùå Violates separation of concerns (agent doing orchestration)
- ‚ùå Makes testing difficult (can't mock agent behavior)

**Impact:**
- Context bloat: 168.9k tokens (no reduction)
- Artifacts may be created in wrong locations
- Inconsistent numbering across workflows

### Anti-Pattern 2: Agent Invokes Command That Invoked It

**WRONG:**
```markdown
# code-writer.md

## Type A: Plan-Based Implementation

If you receive a plan file path, use /implement to execute it:

SlashCommand {
  command: "/implement ${PLAN_PATH}"
}
```

**Why It's Wrong:**
- ‚ùå **Recursion risk**: /implement ‚Üí code-writer ‚Üí /implement ‚Üí ‚àû
- ‚ùå Infinite loops possible
- ‚ùå Agent misunderstanding its role (executor, not orchestrator)

**Impact:**
- Risk of infinite recursion
- Timeouts and failures
- Confused responsibility boundaries

### Anti-Pattern 3: Manual Path Construction

**WRONG:**
```markdown
# research-specialist.md

Create report at: specs/reports/${TOPIC}.md
```

**Why It's Wrong:**
- ‚ùå Breaks topic-based organization (flat structure)
- ‚ùå Inconsistent numbering (no NNN prefix)
- ‚ùå Difficult artifact discovery (scattered locations)
- ‚ùå Non-compliant with directory protocols

**Impact:**
- Reports created in flat structure: `specs/reports/topic.md`
- Should be: `specs/042_topic/reports/042_topic.md`
- Loss of centralized artifact organization

---

## 7. Best Practices and Examples

### DO

- **Be Specific**: Define clear, focused capabilities
- **Reference Standards**: Explicitly mention CLAUDE.md
- **Provide Examples**: Show expected input/output formats
- **Use Active Voice**: "I implement features" not "Features are implemented"
- **Test Thoroughly**: Verify agent loads and behaves correctly
- **Version Control**: Track agent changes in git
- **Document Updates**: Note when and why agent changed

### DON'T

- **Be Vague**: Avoid general statements like "I do things well"
- **Duplicate Existing Agents**: Check if capability exists first
- **Over-Promise**: Only list tools you actually need
- **Ignore Standards**: Always reference project conventions
- **Skip Testing**: Always verify agent loads correctly
- **Use Emojis**: Keep to UTF-8 text, no emoji characters

### Common Patterns

#### Specialized Code Agent

Focus on specific language or framework:

```markdown
---
allowed-tools: Read, Write, Edit, Bash, Grep
description: Specialized in React TypeScript development
---

# React TypeScript Specialist

I am an expert in React and TypeScript, focused on building modern web applications following best practices.

## Core Capabilities
- Component development with hooks
- State management (Context, Redux, Zustand)
- Type-safe props and interfaces
- Performance optimization
- Accessibility (WCAG 2.1)
```

#### Documentation Agent

Focus on writing and maintaining docs:

```markdown
---
allowed-tools: Read, Write, Edit, Grep, Glob
description: Maintains comprehensive project documentation
---

# Documentation Writer

I specialize in creating and maintaining clear, consistent documentation for software projects.

## Core Capabilities
- README files for all directories
- API documentation
- User guides and tutorials
- Architecture diagrams (Unicode box-drawing)
- Changelog maintenance
```

#### Analysis Agent

Focus on investigation without modification:

```markdown
---
allowed-tools: Read, Grep, Glob, WebSearch, WebFetch
description: Analyzes codebases and provides insights
---

# Code Analyst

I conduct thorough analysis of codebases without making modifications, providing insights and recommendations.

## Core Capabilities
- Architecture analysis
- Dependency mapping
- Performance profiling
- Security auditing
- Best practice recommendations
```

### Reference Implementation Examples

#### Pattern 1: Agent Creates Artifact at Provided Path

**CORRECT:**
```markdown
# plan-architect.md

## Step 1: Receive Task Context

You will receive:
- **Feature Description**: The feature to implement
- **Research Reports**: Paths to research that informs the plan
- **Plan Output Path**: EXACT path where plan must be created

## Step 2: Create Implementation Plan

Use the Write tool to create the plan at the EXACT path provided:

Write {
  file_path: "${PLAN_PATH}"  # Use exact path from context
  content: |
    # ${FEATURE} Implementation Plan

    ## Metadata
    - **Research Reports**: (paths provided in context)

    ## Phases
    ...
}

## Step 3: Return Metadata

Return structured metadata:
{
  "path": "${PLAN_PATH}",
  "phase_count": N,
  "complexity_score": XX,
  "estimated_hours": YY
}
```

**Why It's Correct:**
- ‚úÖ Agent uses provided path (no assumptions)
- ‚úÖ Uses Write tool (not SlashCommand)
- ‚úÖ Returns metadata only (no full content)
- ‚úÖ Clear separation of concerns

#### Pattern 2: Research Agent with Topic-Based Artifacts

**CORRECT:**
```markdown
# research-specialist.md

## Step 1: Receive Research Context

You will receive:
- **Research Focus**: Topic to research (patterns, best practices, alternatives)
- **Feature Description**: Context for research
- **Report Output Path**: EXACT topic-based path (specs/{NNN_topic}/reports/{NNN}_topic.md)

## Step 2: Conduct Research

Use Grep, Glob, Read tools to:
1. Search codebase for existing implementations
2. Identify relevant patterns and utilities
3. Research best practices
4. Document alternative approaches

## Step 3: Create Report at Exact Path

Write {
  file_path: "${REPORT_PATH}"  # Topic-based path from context
  content: |
    # ${TOPIC} Research Report

    ## Executive Summary
    (50-word summary)

    ## Findings
    ...

    ## Recommendations
    ...
}

## Step 4: Return Metadata

{
  "path": "${REPORT_PATH}",
  "summary": "50-word summary",
  "key_findings": ["finding 1", "finding 2"],
  "recommendations": ["rec 1", "rec 2"]
}
```

**Why It's Correct:**
- ‚úÖ Uses provided topic-based path
- ‚úÖ Metadata-only return (95% context reduction)
- ‚úÖ Clear research methodology
- ‚úÖ Structured output format

---

## 8. Testing and Validation

### Agent Loading Tests

Verify agent loads correctly:

```lua
local agent = agent_registry.get_agent('my-agent')
if not agent then
  print('ERROR: Agent failed to load')
  return
end

print('Agent loaded: ' .. agent.name)
print('Tools: ' .. table.concat(agent.allowed_tools, ', '))
print('Description: ' .. agent.description)
```

### Manual Testing Procedure

1. Create test agent file
2. Reload agent registry
3. Verify agent appears in list
4. Create task config
5. Test agent invocation
6. Verify expected output

### Quality Checklist
