export WORKFLOW_DESCRIPTION="research the output /home/benjamin/.config/.claude/specs/coordinage_plan.md of the coordinate command which incorrectly identified the workflow as research-and-revise instead of research-and-plan. I am wondering if there is a better way to identify the correct workflow by feeding the prompt and available options into a subagent which runs the haiku model while instructing it to return the most appropriate workflow from the range of options provided. Research this alternative as well as systematically studying the existing implementation in order to create a detailed implementation plan that I can review. Where possible, it is important to follow the .claude/docs/ standards while leaving room to revise standards that need to be updated by this proposed refactor (this should be handled by the final phase of the plan)."
