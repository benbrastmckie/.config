export WORKFLOW_DESCRIPTION="When implementing plans with either the coordinate.md or implement.md commands, I want plans that are completed in full (nothing missing, skipped, or deferred that has not been approved by the user) to be moved to the relevant specs/archived/ directory so as to reduce clutter. Carefully research the existing infrastructure in .claude/ and standards in .claude/docs/ in order to design an elegant implementation plan."
