export WORKFLOW_DESCRIPTION="I have been trying to debug and fix the coordinate command and recently completed the fix reported on in /home/benjamin/.config/.claude/specs/630_fix_coordinate_report_paths_state_persistence/COMPLETE_FIX_SUMMARY.md. Research this report along with the previous attempts in specs/ that have not yet been committed along with the current .claude/ infrastructure and standards in .claude/docs/ in order to create a unified and systematic implementation plan to improving the coordinate command that works with and extends existing functionality to avoid all errors without adding any needless complexity (seeking instead to simplify where possible without breaking anything)."
