export WORKFLOW_DESCRIPTION="I would like to be able to use the coordinate.md command to research-and-revise an already existing plan. Research the existing coordinate.md and revise.md commands as well as the .claude/ infrastructure and .claude/docs/ standards in order to design an implementation plan that avoids needless complexity, extending what already exists in a natural and elegant way by creating a revision specialist subagent that can be invoked if this workflow is initialized. After the plan has been created, implement the plan."
