# Lean Implementation Execution Flow

Reference: Load when executing lean-implementation-agent after Stage 0.

## Prerequisites

- Early metadata initialized (Stage 0 complete)
- Implementation plan available

---

## Stage 1: Parse Delegation Context

Extract from input:
```json
{
  "task_context": {
    "task_number": 259,
    "task_name": "prove_completeness_theorem",
    "description": "...",
    "language": "lean"
  },
  "metadata": {
    "session_id": "sess_...",
    "delegation_depth": 1,
    "delegation_path": ["orchestrator", "implement", "lean-implementation-agent"]
  },
  "plan_path": "specs/259_completeness/plans/implementation-001.md",
  "metadata_file_path": "specs/259_completeness/.return-meta.json"
}
```

---

## Stage 2: Load and Parse Implementation Plan

Read the plan file and extract:
- Phase list with status markers ([NOT STARTED], [IN PROGRESS], [COMPLETED], [PARTIAL])
- Files to modify per phase
- Steps within each phase
- Verification criteria

---

## Stage 3: Find Resume Point

Scan phases for first incomplete:
- `[COMPLETED]` -> Skip
- `[IN PROGRESS]` -> Resume here
- `[PARTIAL]` -> Resume here
- `[NOT STARTED]` -> Start here

If all phases are `[COMPLETED]`: Task already done, return completed status.

---

## Stage 4: Execute Proof Development Loop

For each phase starting from resume point:

### 4A. Mark Phase In Progress

Edit plan file: Change phase status to `[IN PROGRESS]`

### 4B. Execute Proof Development

For each proof/theorem in the phase:

1. **Read target file, locate proof point**
   - Use `Read` to get current file contents
   - Identify the theorem/lemma to prove

2. **Check current proof state**
   - Use `lean_goal` to see current goals
   - If "no goals" -> proof already complete

3. **Develop proof iteratively**
   ```
   REPEAT until goals closed or stuck:
     a. Use lean_goal to see current state
     b. Use lean_multi_attempt to try candidate tactics:
        - ["simp", "ring", "omega", "decide"]
        - ["exact h", "apply h", "intro h"]
        - Domain-specific tactics from context
     c. If promising tactic found:
        - Apply via Edit tool
        - Use lean_goal to verify progress
     d. If stuck:
        - Use lean_state_search for goal-closing lemmas
        - Use lean_hammer_premise for simp premises
        - Use lean_local_search to find related definitions
     e. If still stuck after multiple attempts:
        - Log current state
        - Return partial with recommendation
   ```

4. **Verify step completion**
   - Use `lean_goal` to confirm goals are closed
   - Run `lake build` to verify no compilation errors

### 4C. Verify Phase Completion

- Run `lake build` to verify full project builds
- Check verification criteria from plan

### 4D. Mark Phase Complete

Edit plan file: Change phase status to `[COMPLETED]`

---

## Stage 5: Run Final Build Verification

After all phases complete:
```bash
lake build
```

If build fails:
- Capture error output
- Return partial with build errors

---

## Stage 6: Create Implementation Summary

Write to `specs/{N}_{SLUG}/summaries/implementation-summary-{DATE}.md`:

```markdown
# Implementation Summary: Task #{N}

**Completed**: {ISO_DATE}
**Duration**: {time}

## Changes Made

{Summary of proofs developed}

## Files Modified

- `Logos/Layer{X}/File.lean` - {proof description}

## Verification

- Lake build: Success/Failure
- All goals closed: Yes/No
- Tests passed: {if applicable}

## Notes

{Any additional notes, follow-up items, or caveats}
```

---

## Stage 6a: Generate Completion Data

**CRITICAL**: Before writing metadata, prepare the `completion_data` object.

1. Generate `completion_summary`: A 1-3 sentence description of what was accomplished
   - Focus on the mathematical/proof outcome
   - Include key theorems and lemmas proven
   - Example: "Proved completeness theorem using canonical model construction. Implemented 4 supporting lemmas including truth lemma and existence lemma."

2. Optionally generate `roadmap_items`: Array of explicit ROAD_MAP.md item texts this task addresses
   - Only include if the task clearly maps to specific roadmap items
   - Example: `["Prove completeness theorem for K modal logic"]`

**Example completion_data for Lean task**:
```json
{
  "completion_summary": "Proved soundness theorem for modal logic K with 3 supporting lemmas. All proofs verified with lake build.",
  "roadmap_items": ["Prove soundness for K modal logic"]
}
```

**Example completion_data without roadmap items**:
```json
{
  "completion_summary": "Refactored Kripke frame definitions to use bundled structures. All existing proofs updated and verified."
}
```

---

## Stage 7: Write Metadata File

**CRITICAL**: Write metadata to the specified file path, NOT to console.

Write to `specs/{N}_{SLUG}/.return-meta.json`:

```json
{
  "status": "implemented|partial|failed",
  "summary": "Brief 2-5 sentence summary (<100 tokens)",
  "artifacts": [
    {
      "type": "implementation",
      "path": "Logos/Layer1/Soundness.lean",
      "summary": "Completed soundness proof with 3 lemmas"
    },
    {
      "type": "summary",
      "path": "specs/{N}_{SLUG}/summaries/implementation-summary-{DATE}.md",
      "summary": "Implementation summary with verification results"
    }
  ],
  "completion_data": {
    "completion_summary": "1-3 sentence description of proofs accomplished",
    "roadmap_items": ["Optional: roadmap item text this task addresses"]
  },
  "metadata": {
    "session_id": "{from delegation context}",
    "duration_seconds": 123,
    "agent_type": "lean-implementation-agent",
    "delegation_depth": 1,
    "delegation_path": ["orchestrator", "implement", "lean-implementation-agent"],
    "phases_completed": 3,
    "phases_total": 3
  },
  "next_steps": "Review implementation summary and run tests"
}
```

**Note**: Include `completion_data` when status is `implemented`. The `roadmap_items` field is optional.

Use the Write tool to create this file.

---

## Stage 8: Return Brief Text Summary

**CRITICAL**: Return a brief text summary (3-6 bullet points), NOT JSON.

Example return:
```
Lean implementation completed for task 259:
- All 3 phases executed, completeness theorem proven with 4 lemmas
- Lake build: Success
- Key theorems: completeness_main, soundness_lemma, modal_truth
- Created summary at specs/259_completeness/summaries/implementation-summary-20260118.md
- Metadata written for skill postflight
```

**DO NOT return JSON to the console**. The skill reads metadata from the file.

---

## Phase Checkpoint Protocol

For each phase in the implementation plan:

1. **Read plan file**, identify current phase
2. **Update phase status** to `[IN PROGRESS]` in plan file
3. **Execute proof development** as documented
4. **Update phase status** to `[COMPLETED]` or `[BLOCKED]` or `[PARTIAL]`
5. **Git commit** with message: `task {N} phase {P}: {phase_name}`
   ```bash
   git add -A && git commit -m "task {N} phase {P}: {phase_name}

   Session: {session_id}

   Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.5 <noreply@anthropic.com>"
   ```
6. **Proceed to next phase** or return if blocked

**This ensures**:
- Resume point is always discoverable from plan file
- Git history reflects phase-level progress
- Failed proofs can be retried from beginning

---

## Proof Development Loop Details

### Tactic Selection Strategy

1. **Start Simple**
   - Try `simp`, `rfl`, `trivial` first
   - Try `decide` for decidable propositions
   - Try `ring` or `omega` for arithmetic

2. **Structural Tactics**
   - `intro` for implications/foralls
   - `cases` or `rcases` for disjunctions/existentials
   - `induction` for recursive types

3. **Application Tactics**
   - `exact h` when hypothesis matches goal exactly
   - `apply lemma` to reduce goal using lemma
   - `have` to introduce intermediate facts

4. **Automation**
   - `simp [lemma1, lemma2]` with specific lemmas
   - `aesop` for goal search
   - `omega` for linear arithmetic

### When Stuck

If a proof gets stuck after 5-10 attempts:

1. **Search for help**
   - `lean_state_search` to find closing lemmas
   - `lean_hammer_premise` for simp premises
   - `lean_local_search` for related definitions

2. **Try different approach**
   - Reorder tactics
   - Introduce helper lemmas
   - Use `have` to build up intermediate goals

3. **If still stuck**
   - Document current proof state
   - Log what was tried
   - Return partial with specific recommendation

---

## Error Handling

### MCP Tool Error Recovery

When MCP tool calls fail during proof development (AbortError -32001 or similar):

1. **Log the error context** (tool name, operation, proof state, session_id)
2. **Retry once** after 5-second delay for timeout errors
3. **Try alternative tool** per this fallback table:

| Primary Tool | Alternative | Fallback |
|--------------|-------------|----------|
| `lean_diagnostic_messages` | `lean_goal` | `lake build` via Bash |
| `lean_goal` | (essential - retry more) | Document state manually |
| `lean_state_search` | `lean_hammer_premise` | Manual tactic exploration |
| `lean_local_search` | (no alternative) | Continue with available info |

4. **Update partial_progress** in metadata:
   ```json
   {
     "status": "in_progress",
     "partial_progress": {
       "stage": "phase_{N}_mcp_recovery",
       "details": "MCP tool {tool_name} failed during phase {N}. Attempting recovery.",
       "phases_completed": {N-1},
       "phases_total": {total}
     }
   }
   ```
5. **If lean_goal fails repeatedly**: Save current proof state to file, document what was attempted
6. **Continue with available information** - don't block entire implementation on one tool failure

See `.claude/context/core/patterns/mcp-tool-recovery.md` for detailed recovery patterns.

### Build Failure

When `lake build` fails:
1. Capture full error output
2. Use `lean_goal` to check proof state at error location
3. Attempt to fix if error is clear
4. If unfixable, return partial with:
   - Build error message
   - File and line of error
   - Recommendation for fix

### Proof Stuck

When proof cannot be completed:
1. Save partial progress (do not delete)
2. Document current proof state via `lean_goal`
3. Return partial with:
   - What was proven
   - Current goal state
   - Attempted tactics
   - Recommendation for next steps

### Timeout/Interruption

If time runs out:
1. Save all progress made
2. Mark current phase `[PARTIAL]` in plan
3. Commit partial work if significant
4. Return partial with:
   - Phases completed
   - Current position in current phase
   - Resume information

### Invalid Task or Plan

If task or plan is invalid:
1. Write `failed` status to metadata file
2. Include clear error message
3. Return brief error summary
