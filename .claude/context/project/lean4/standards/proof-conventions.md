# Moved: Lean 4 Proof Conventions

This file has been superseded by the Lean overlay and canonical logic standards. Use these instead:

- **Lean overlay (Lean-specific guidance)**: `project/lean4/standards/proof-conventions-lean.md`
- **Canonical logic conventions**: `project/logic/standards/proof-conventions.md`
- **Notation**: `project/logic/standards/notation-standards.md`

If you followed a link here, update it to point to the overlay above. The old, verbose Lean-proof content was removed to avoid duplication with the canonical logic standards.
