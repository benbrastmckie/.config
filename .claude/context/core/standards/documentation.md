# Documentation Standards

## Purpose

Documentation standards for the .opencode AI system and ProofChecker repository.
These standards ensure documentation is clear, concise, accurate, and optimized for
AI agent consumption.

## Core Principles

1. **Clear**: Use precise technical language without ambiguity
2. **Concise**: Avoid bloat, historical mentions, and redundancy
3. **Accurate**: Document current state only, not past versions or future plans
4. **Consistent**: Follow established patterns and conventions
5. **AI-Optimized**: Structure for efficient AI agent parsing and understanding

## General Standards

### Content Guidelines

**Do**:
- Document what exists now
- Use present tense
- Provide concrete examples
- Include verification commands where applicable
- Link to related documentation
- Use technical precision

**Don't**:
- Include historical information about past versions
- Mention "we changed X to Y" or "previously this was Z"
- Use emojis anywhere in documentation
- Include speculative future plans
- Duplicate information across files
- Use vague or ambiguous language
- Add "Version History" sections (this is useless cruft)
- Include version numbers in documentation (e.g., "v1.0.0", "v2.0.0")
- Document what changed between versions

### Formatting Standards

#### Line Length
- Maximum 100 characters per line
- Break long lines at natural boundaries (after punctuation, before conjunctions)

#### Headings
- Use ATX-style headings (`#`, `##`, `###`)
- Never use Setext-style underlines (`===`, `---`)
- Capitalize first word and proper nouns only

#### Code Blocks
- Always specify language for syntax highlighting
- Use `lean` for LEAN 4 code
- Use `bash` for shell commands
- Use `json` for JSON examples

#### File Trees
- Use Unicode box-drawing characters for directory trees
- Format: `├──`, `└──`, `│`
- Example:
  ```
  .claude/
  ├── .claude/context/
  │   ├── core/
  │   │   ├── repo/
  │   │   │   └── documentation.md
  │   │   └── lean4/
  └── specs/
  ```

#### Lists
- Use `-` for unordered lists
- Use `1.`, `2.`, `3.` for ordered lists
- Indent nested lists with 2 spaces

### NO EMOJI Policy

**Enforcement**: See `.claude/AGENTS.md` for centralized rule (automatically loaded by OpenCode).

**Prohibition**: No emojis are permitted anywhere in .opencode system files.

**Rationale**:
- Emojis are ambiguous and culture-dependent
- Text-based alternatives are clearer and more accessible
- Emojis interfere with grep/search operations
- Professional documentation should use precise language

**Text Alternatives**:
| Emoji | Text Alternative | Usage |
|-------|-----------------|-------|
| [PASS] (was checkmark) | [PASS], [COMPLETE], [YES] | Success indicators |
| [FAIL] (was cross mark) | [FAIL], [NOT RECOMMENDED], [NO] | Failure indicators |
| [WARN] (was warning) | [WARN], [PARTIAL], [CAUTION] | Warning indicators |
| [TARGET] (was target) | [TARGET], [GOAL] | Objectives |
| [IDEA] (was lightbulb) | [IDEA], [TIP], [NOTE] | Suggestions |

**Validation**:
Before committing any artifact, verify no emojis present:
```bash
grep -E "[\x{1F300}-\x{1F9FF}\x{2600}-\x{26FF}\x{2700}-\x{27BF}]" file.md
```

If emojis found, replace with text alternatives from table above.

### NO VERSION HISTORY Policy

**Prohibition**: Version history sections are FORBIDDEN in all .opencode documentation.

**Rationale**:
- Version history is useless cruft that clutters documentation
- Git history already tracks all changes comprehensively
- Historical information becomes stale and misleading
- Documentation should describe current state only
- Version numbers (v1.0.0, v2.0.0, etc.) add no value
- "What changed" information is irrelevant to current usage

**Examples of Forbidden Content**:
```markdown
## Version History

- v5.0.0 (2026-01-05): Optimized with direct delegation
- v4.0.0 (2026-01-05): Full refactor with --divide flag
- v3.0.0 (2026-01-05): Simplified to direct implementation
```

**Correct Approach**:
- Document current behavior only
- Use git log to track changes
- Update documentation in-place when behavior changes
- Remove outdated information immediately

**Validation**:
Before committing any documentation, verify no version history:
```bash
grep -i "version history" file.md
grep -E "v[0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.[0-9]+" file.md
```

If version history found, remove it entirely.

### Cross-References

#### Internal Links
- Use relative paths from current file location
- Format: `[Link Text](relative/path/to/file.md)`
- Include section anchors when referencing specific sections:
  `[Section Name](file.md#section-anchor)`

#### External Links
- Use full URLs for external resources
- Include link text that describes the destination
- Verify links are accessible before committing

## LEAN 4 Specific Standards

### Formal Symbols
All Unicode formal symbols must be wrapped in backticks:
- `□` (box/necessity)
- `◇` (diamond/possibility)
- `△` (triangle)
- `▽` (nabla)
- `⊢` (turnstile/proves)
- `⊨` (double turnstile/models)

**Correct**: "The formula `□φ` represents necessity"
**Incorrect**: "The formula □φ represents necessity"

### Code Documentation
- All public definitions require docstrings
- Follow LEAN 4 docstring format with `/-!` and `-/`
- Include type signatures in examples
- Document preconditions and postconditions

### Module Documentation
- Each `.lean` file should have module-level documentation
- Explain purpose and key definitions
- Link to related modules
- Provide usage examples for complex functionality

## Directory README Standards

### When README Required
- Top-level source directories
- Test directories with 3+ subdirectories
- Example/archive directories
- Multi-subdirectory documentation roots

### When README Not Required
- Single-module directories with excellent `.lean` module documentation
- Subdirectories when parent README provides sufficient navigation
- Build/output directories
- Directories with <3 files that are self-explanatory

### README Structure
1. **Title**: Directory name as H1
2. **Purpose**: 1-2 sentence description
3. **Organization**: Subdirectory listing with brief descriptions
4. **Quick Reference**: Where to find specific functionality
5. **Usage**: How to build, test, or run (if applicable)
6. **Related Documentation**: Links to relevant docs

### README Anti-Patterns
- Duplicating `.lean` docstrings
- Describing files/structure that no longer exists
- Creating READMEs for simple directories
- Including implementation details better suited for code comments

## .opencode System Documentation

### Context Files
Context files in `.claude/context/` provide knowledge for AI agents:

**Structure**:
- `core/`: Core system standards, workflows, repo, templates
- `lean4/`: LEAN 4 specific knowledge (domain, patterns, processes, tools)
- `logic/`: Logic domain knowledge (proof theory, semantics, metalogic)
- `math/`: Mathematical domain knowledge

**Guidelines**:
- Keep files focused on single topics
- Use hierarchical organization
- Provide concrete examples
- Include verification procedures where applicable
- Cross-reference related context files

### Artifact Documentation
Artifacts in `.claude/specs/` are organized by project:

**Structure**:
- `NNN_project_name/reports/`: Research and analysis reports
- `NNN_project_name/plans/`: Implementation plans (versioned)
- `NNN_project_name/summaries/`: Brief summaries

**Guidelines**:
- Use descriptive project names
- Increment plan versions when revising
- Keep summaries to 1-2 pages maximum
- Link artifacts to .claude/specs/TODO.md tasks
- Update state.json after operations

## Validation

### Pre-Commit Checks
Before committing documentation:

1. **Syntax**: Validate markdown syntax
2. **Links**: Verify all internal links resolve
3. **Line Length**: Check 100-character limit compliance
4. **Formal Symbols**: Ensure backticks around Unicode symbols
5. **Code Blocks**: Verify language specification
6. **Consistency**: Check cross-file consistency

### Automated Validation
```bash
# Validate line length
awk 'length > 100 {print FILENAME" line "NR" exceeds 100 chars"; exit 1}' file.md

# Check for unbackticked formal symbols
grep -E "□|◇|△|▽|⊢|⊨" file.md | grep -v '`'

# Validate JSON syntax in code blocks
jq empty file.json

# Check for broken internal links
# (requires custom script)
```

# Documentation Standards

## Quick Reference

**Golden Rule**: If users ask the same question twice, document it

**Document** (**DO**):
- WHY decisions were made
- Complex algorithms/logic
- Public APIs, setup, common use cases

**Don't Document** (**DON'T**):
- Obvious code (i++ doesn't need comment)
- What code does (should be self-explanatory)

**Principles**: Audience-focused, Show don't tell, Keep current

---

## Principles

**Audience-focused**: Write for users (what/how), developers (why/when), contributors (setup/conventions)
**Show, don't tell**: Code examples, real use cases, expected output
**Keep current**: Update with code changes, remove outdated info, mark deprecations

## README Structure

```markdown
# Project Name
Brief description (1-2 sentences)

## Features
- Key feature 1
- Key feature 2

## Installation
`bash
npm install package-name
`

## Quick Start
`javascript
const result = doSomething();
`

## Usage
[Detailed examples]

## API Reference
[If applicable]

## Contributing
[Link to CONTRIBUTING.md]

## License
[License type]
```

## Function Documentation

`javascript
/**
 * Calculate total price including tax
 * 
 * @param {number} price - Base price
 * @param {number} taxRate - Tax rate (0-1)
 * @returns {number} Total with tax
 * 
 * @example
 * calculateTotal(100, 0.1) // 110
 */
function calculateTotal(price, taxRate) {
  return price * (1 + taxRate);
}
`

## What to Document

### **DO**
- **WHY** decisions were made
- Complex algorithms/logic
- Non-obvious behavior
- Public APIs
- Setup/installation
- Common use cases
- Known limitations
- Workarounds (with explanation)

### **DON'T**
- Obvious code (i++ doesn't need comment)
- What code does (should be self-explanatory)
- Redundant information
- Outdated/incorrect info

## Comments

### Good
`javascript
// Calculate discount by tier (Bronze: 5%, Silver: 10%, Gold: 15%)
const discount = getDiscountByTier(customer.tier);

// HACK: API returns null instead of [], normalize it
const items = response.items || [];

// TODO: Use async/await when Node 18+ is minimum
`

## Bad
`javascript
// Increment i
i++;

// Get user
const user = getUser();
`

## API Documentation

`markdown
### POST /api/users
Create a new user

**Request:**
`json
{ "name": "John", "email": "john@example.com" }
`

**Response:**
`json
{ "id": "123", "name": "John", "email": "john@example.com" }
`

**Errors:**
- 400 - Invalid input
- 409 - Email exists
```

## Best Practices

- Explain WHY, not just WHAT
- Include working examples
- Show expected output
- Cover error handling
- Use consistent terminology
- Keep structure predictable
- Update when code changes

**Golden Rule**: If users ask the same question twice, document it.

## Prohibited Elements

### No Emas
Do not use emojis in documentation. Use text-based alternatives:
- Status: `[COMPLETE]`, `[PARTIAL]`, `[NOT STARTED]`, `[FAILED]`
- Emphasis: Use `**DO**` and `**DON'T**` or bold/italics
- Lists: Use standard markdown bullets or numbered lists

Mathematical symbols (→, ∧, ∨, ¬, □, ◇) are NOT emojis and must be preserved.
