> /coordinate is running… research the /home/benjamin/.config/.claude/commands/shared/ directory to 
see which files can be removed on account of being unused or used only by the /orchestrate command 
which will soon be removed, creating a plan for me to review 
  ⎿  Allowed 4 tools for this command

● I'll help you research the /home/benjamin/.config/.claude/commands/shared/ directory to identify
   files that can be removed. Let me start by creating a todo list and then conducting the
  research.

● Now let me examine the shared/ directory structure and analyze file usage:

● Bash(ls -la /home/benjamin/.config/.claude/commands/shared/)
  ⎿  total 404                                        
     drwxr-xr-x 2 benjamin users  4096 Oct 27 11:13 .
     drwxr-xr-x 4 benjamin users  4096 Oct 27 11:45 ..
     … +34 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

● Bash(find /home/benjamin/.config/.claude/commands -name "*.md" -type f | wc -l)
  ⎿  56

● Now let me search for references to these shared files across all command files:

● Bash(cd /home/benjamin/.config/.claude/commands && grep -r "shared/" --include="*.md" . | grep -v
      "^./shared/" | wc -l)
  ⎿  12

● Bash(cd /home/benjamin/.config/.claude/commands && for file in shared/*.md; do
      basename_file=$(basename "$file"); echo "=== $basename_file ==="; grep -l "$basename_f…)
  ⎿  Error: /run/current-system/sw/bin/bash: eval: line 1: syntax error near unexpected token 
     `basename'
     /run/current-system/sw/bin/bash: eval: line 1: `cd /home/benjamin/.config/.claude/commands && for
 
     file in shared/*.md ; do basename_file\=\$ ( basename '' ) ; echo '===  ===' ; grep -l '' *.md 
     2>/dev/null < /dev/null | grep -v \^shared/ || echo '(no references)' ; done'

● Let me fix that command:

● Bash(for file in shared/*.md; do filename=$(basename "$file"); echo "=== $filename ==="; grep -l
      "$filename" *.md 2>/dev/null || echo "(no references)"; echo ""; don…)
  ⎿  === adaptive-planning.md ===   
     (no references)
     … +101 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

● Now let me check the orchestrate.md file to see what it references:

● Bash(grep -o "shared/[^)]*\.md" orchestrate.md | sort -u)
  ⎿  shared/orchestration-alternatives.md
     shared/orchestration-patterns.md

● Bash(ls orchestrate.md 2>/dev/null && echo "orchestrate.md exists" || echo "orchestrate.md does not
      exist")
  ⎿  orchestrate.md       
     orchestrate.md exists

● Let me also check if there are any references in the docs directory:

● Bash(find /home/benjamin/.config/.claude -name "*.md" -type f | xargs grep -l "commands/shared/"
      2>/dev/null | head -20)
  ⎿ /home/benjamin/.config/.claude/specs/002_report_creation/plans/002_fix_all_command_subagent_d
    elegation/002_fix_all_command_subagent_delegation.md
    /home/benjamin/.config/.claude/specs/483_remove_all_mentions_of_archived_content_in_claude_/r
    … +32 lines (ctrl+o to expand)



● Bash(cat shared/README.md)
  ⎿  # Shared Command Documentation

     ## Purpose
     … +74 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

● Now let me read a few key shared files to understand their purpose and check if they're
  orchestrate-specific:

● Bash(head -30 shared/orchestrate-enhancements.md)
  ⎿ # Orchestration Enhancements Reference
