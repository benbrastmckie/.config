# TODO 2

The /orchestrate command does not require the research subagents that it invokes to create reports as desired, passing the reference and brief summary for each back to the primary agent, and it calls the /plan command instead of a planning subagent. This is not the desired functionality.

## Current Functionality

> /orchestrate is running… the /orchestrate command in .claude/commands/ has grown and I want to research a systematic refactor
 that addresses the concerns raised in /home/benjamin/.config/.claude/TODO3.md while maintaining strict compliance with the 
standards set in .claude/docs/. Conduct careful and complete research, creating an implementation plan for me to review. 
  ⎿  Allowed 7 tools for this command

● I'll orchestrate a comprehensive workflow to research and plan a systematic refactor of the /orchestrate command. Let me
  start by analyzing the workflow and creating a task plan.

● Now let me launch parallel research agents to investigate the different aspects of this refactoring task.

● Task(Analyze orchestrate command implementation)
  ⎿  Done (27 tool uses · 37.8k tokens · 1m 28s)                                                                          

● Task(Review command architecture standards)
  ⎿  Done (5 tool uses · 84.2k tokens · 42.2s)                                                                            

● Task(Research refactoring patterns)
  ⎿  Done (27 tool uses · 64.0k tokens · 1m 40s)                                                                          

● Excellent! All three research agents have completed their analysis. Let me synthesize these findings and move to the
  planning phase.

● Now I'll create a comprehensive implementation plan using the /plan command.

> /plan is running… Systematic refactor of /orchestrate command to address TODO3.md concerns while maintaining strict 
compliance with .claude/docs/ standards. Remove automatic complexity evaluation (Phase 2.5) and automatic expansion (Phase 4), 
simplify to clean 6-phase architecture, add user control via AskUserQuestion after planning phase, transfer expansion logic to 
/expand command, reduce file size by 30-40%, and ensure all execution-critical content remains inline per command architecture 
standards.

● I'll create a comprehensive implementation plan for this systematic refactor. Let me first read the necessary files to
  understand the current state and requirements.

● Read(.claude/TODO3.md)
  ⎿  Read 10 lines

● Read(.claude/commands/orchestrate.md)
  ⎿  Read 500 lines

● Read(.claude/docs/reference/command_architecture_standards.md)
  ⎿  Read 300 lines

● Let me continue reading more of the orchestrate.md file to understand the current phase structure, and find existing
  plans to determine the correct numbering.

● Bash(find /home/benjamin/.config/.claude/specs -name "*.md" -path "*/plans/*" | grep -E
      "^/home/benjamin/.config/.claude/specs/[0-9]+" | sort | tail -5)
  ⎿ /home/benjamin/.config/.claude/specs/068_orchestrate_execution_enforcement/plans/001_execution_enforcement_fix/phase_2

● Read(.claude/commands/orchestrate.md)
  ⎿  Read 400 lines

● Read(.claude/commands/orchestrate.md)
  ⎿  Read 400 lines

● Now let me check the directory structure and create the implementation plan. Based on the research, the next plan number
  should be 070.

● Bash(ls -1d /home/benjamin/.config/.claude/specs/[0-9]* 2>/dev/null | sort | tail -1)
  ⎿  /home/benjamin/.config/.claude/specs/069_implement_spec_updater_fix

● Perfect! The next topic number is 070. Now I'll create the comprehensive implementation plan.
