● I'll analyze the /coordinate command failure and related issues by examining the command structure and comparing it to
  working patterns.

● Read(.claude/commands/coordinate.md)
  ⎿  Read 2370 lines

● Read(.claude/TODO1.md)
  ⎿  Read 93 lines

● Read(.claude/commands/orchestrate.md)
  ⎿  Read 500 lines

● I can see the issue now! When you ran /coordinate, instead of invoking research subagents through the Task tool, it
  appears to have written output to a TODO file. Let me examine the full scope of issues with the /coordinate command and
  related architectural problems.

● Search(pattern: ".claude/agents/*.md")
  ⎿  Found 19 files (ctrl+o to expand)

● Search(pattern: "research-specialist", path: ".claude/commands/coordinate.md", output_mode: "content")
  ⎿  Found 6 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

● Search(pattern: "Task \{|subagent_type", path: ".claude/commands/coordinate.md", output_mode: "content")
  ⎿  Found 22 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

● Now I need to check what happened in the actual execution and compare the architectural patterns:

● Search(pattern: "EXECUTE NOW|USE the Task tool", path: ".claude/commands/coordinate.md", output_mode: "content")
  ⎿  Found 80 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

● Bash(grep -n "<!-- This Task invocation is executable -->" /home/benjamin/.config/.claude/commands/coordinate.md)
  ⎿  87:<!-- This Task invocation is executable -->

● I now understand the critical issue! The /coordinate command has markdown code fences around Task invocations (the
  YAML-like syntax), making them appear as documentation examples rather than executable instructions. Let me create a
  comprehensive research report analyzing all the problems:

● I see the /research command has been invoked and is now running. However, I notice this is experiencing the same issue
  you reported - the command appears to be trying to execute bash code blocks and YAML templates rather than properly
  delegating to research agents.

  Let me create a direct diagnostic report for you about the /coordinate command failure and related architectural issues:
