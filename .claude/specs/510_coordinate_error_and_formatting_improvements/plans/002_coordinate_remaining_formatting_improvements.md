# Implementation Plan: /coordinate Remaining Formatting Improvements

## Metadata

- **Plan ID**: 510-002
- **Related Spec**: 510_coordinate_error_and_formatting_improvements
- **Input Report**: 002_remaining_formatting_issues_analysis.md
- **Prerequisite Plan**: 510-001 (assumed partially complete)
- **Total Complexity**: 5.5/10
- **Estimated Total Time**: 6.5-8.5 hours
- **Risk Level**: Low
- **Priority**: High (user experience critical)

## Objectives

Complete the formatting improvements for /coordinate command to achieve clean, concise user-facing output while maintaining diagnostic verbosity on failures.

**Success Criteria**:
- Bash tool invocations MUST NOT be visible in user output
- MANDATORY VERIFICATION boxes MUST be replaced with concise format (1-2 lines on success)
- Workflow scope detection output MUST show simple phase list (phases to run vs skip) in ~5-10 lines (not 71)
- Progress markers MUST be consistent throughout all phases
- Context usage MUST be reduced by 40-50% overall
- >95% file creation reliability MUST be maintained through proper agent invocation (avoid fallbacks)

## Overview

Analysis of coordinate_output.md reveals 4 remaining formatting issues after plan 510-001 implementation. The issues range from critical (Bash tool invocations visible) to low priority (progress marker inconsistencies). Total estimated effort: 6.5-8.5 hours across 4 priorities.

**Key Issues**:
1. **F-01 (Critical)**: Bash tool invocations visible - `Bash(cat > /tmp/...` showing in output
2. **F-02 (High)**: MANDATORY VERIFICATION boxes still present despite Phase 2 completion claims
3. **F-03 (Medium)**: Workflow scope detection produces 71 lines of verbose output (need simple report showing phases to run)
4. **F-04 (Low)**: Progress marker format inconsistencies

**Root Causes**:
- workflow-initialization.sh library producing verbose output not suppressed
- Plan 510-001 Phase 2 either incomplete or not tested
- Progress markers (Phase 3) not yet implemented

## Phase 0: Verify Implementation Status [COMPLETED]

**Objective**: Determine actual state of coordinate.md compared to plan 510-001 completion claims

**Priority**: Critical prerequisite
**Complexity**: 1/10 (verification only, no changes)
**Estimated Time**: 30 minutes
**Risk**: None (read-only analysis)
**Dependencies**: None

### Root Cause Analysis

Plan 510-001 marks Phase 1-2 as complete (checkboxes [x]), but output shows:
- MANDATORY VERIFICATION boxes still present (contradicts Phase 2 objective)
- Verbose workflow scope output (contradicts concise format goal)
- No evidence of verify_file_created() helper function in use
- Awkward bash command visibility (Bash tool invocations shown to user)

**Possible Explanations**:
1. Changes made to coordinate.md but not tested
2. Output file captured before Phase 2 implementation
3. Phase 2 implementation incomplete (documentation only)
4. Testing insufficient (changes not validated)

**Revision 4 Simplification**:
- Remove verbose/default mode complexity (single workflow only)
- Display clean "Workflow Scope Detection" report (not bash commands)
- Eliminate WORKFLOW_INIT_VERBOSE flag (unnecessary complexity)
- Keep output simple and functional

### Tasks

#### Task 0.1: Check coordinate.md Current State

**File**: `/home/benjamin/.config/.claude/commands/coordinate.md`

**Actions**:
1. Search for verify_file_created() helper function

   **EXECUTE NOW**:
   ```bash
   grep -n "verify_file_created()" /home/benjamin/.config/.claude/commands/coordinate.md
   ```
   Expected: Function definition present (plan Task 2.1, lines 248-325)

2. Check Phase 1 verification section

   **EXECUTE NOW**:
   ```bash
   grep -A 50 "Verifying research reports" /home/benjamin/.config/.claude/commands/coordinate.md
   ```
   Expected: Concise format with echo -n "✓" pattern (plan Task 2.2)

3. Check for MANDATORY VERIFICATION boxes

   **EXECUTE NOW**:
   ```bash
   grep -n "MANDATORY VERIFICATION" /home/benjamin/.config/.claude/commands/coordinate.md
   ```
   Expected: 0 results if Phase 2 complete, 4+ results if incomplete

**Validation**:
- [x] verify_file_created() function exists
- [x] Concise verification format in Phase 1
- [x] No MANDATORY VERIFICATION box-drawing in code

#### Task 0.2: Test Current coordinate Command

**Actions**:
1. Run coordinate with simple test workflow

   **EXECUTE NOW**:
   ```bash
   /coordinate "research test topic" > /tmp/coordinate_test_output.log 2>&1
   ```

2. Check for formatting issues

   **EXECUTE NOW**:
   ```bash
   # Issue F-01: Bash tool invocations
   grep "Bash(cat >" /tmp/coordinate_test_output.log

   # Issue F-02: MANDATORY VERIFICATION boxes
   grep "MANDATORY VERIFICATION" /tmp/coordinate_test_output.log

   # Issue F-03: Verbose scope detection
   grep -A 30 "Workflow Scope Detection" /tmp/coordinate_test_output.log | wc -l
   ```

3. Document actual vs expected state
   - Current verification format: [verbose/concise]
   - Current scope detection: [verbose/concise]
   - Current progress markers: [consistent/inconsistent]

**Deliverable**: Status report documenting which phases of 510-001 are actually complete

#### Task 0.3: Update Plan 510-001 Completion Status

**File**: `/home/benjamin/.config/.claude/specs/510_coordinate_error_and_formatting_improvements/plans/001_coordinate_error_formatting_fix_plan.md`

**Actions**:
1. Update Phase 1 checkboxes based on actual state
2. Update Phase 2 checkboxes based on actual state
3. Update Phase 3 checkboxes based on actual state
4. Add note: "Status updated 2025-10-28 after verification audit"

**Validation**:
- [x] Plan checkboxes reflect actual working state
- [x] No false completion claims remain

### Success Criteria

- [x] Accurate assessment of coordinate.md current state
- [x] Fresh test output captured for comparison
- [x] Plan 510-001 completion status corrected
- [x] Clear understanding of remaining work
- [x] Documented discrepancies between plan and reality

## Phase 1: Suppress Library Verbose Output [COMPLETED]

**Objective**: Reduce workflow-initialization.sh output from 30+ lines to 1 line

**Priority**: High (addresses F-01 and F-03)
**Complexity**: 3/10 (simple output suppression)
**Estimated Time**: 1 hour
**Risk**: Low (display-only change, no functional impact)
**Dependencies**: None (independent fix)

### Root Cause Analysis

**Issue F-01**: Bash tool invocations visible
- workflow-initialization.sh produces verbose output
- Claude Code displays Bash tool syntax when executing library calls
- Users see `Bash(cat > /tmp/...` instead of clean workflow description

**Issue F-03**: Verbose workflow scope display (71 lines)
- Library function `initialize_workflow_paths()` echoes 30+ lines
- Includes detailed scope explanations, path calculations, verification output
- Appropriate for debugging, but excessive for normal operation

**Root Cause**: Library produces output, should be silent by default

**Simplified Solution (Revisions 4-5)**:
- Remove ALL library echo statements (no verbose/silent modes)
- coordinate.md displays simple "Workflow Scope" report showing:
  - Which phases will run
  - Which phases will be skipped
  - Essential workflow info only (~5-10 lines total, not 71)
- No environment variables needed (WORKFLOW_INIT_VERBOSE removed)
- Single, simple workflow

### Tasks

#### Task 1.1: Remove All Library Echo Statements

**File**: `/home/benjamin/.config/.claude/lib/workflow-initialization.sh`
**Lines**: Throughout file

**Actions**:
1. REMOVE all echo statements from library (silent by default)
2. KEEP only error messages (echo to stderr)
3. coordinate.md WILL display user-facing output

**Philosophy**:
- Libraries MUST be silent (no output)
- Commands display what users see
- Simpler than verbose/silent modes
- No environment variables needed

**Validation**:
- [x] All echo statements removed (except errors)
- [x] Error messages still visible (stderr)

#### Task 1.2: Remove Scope Detection Output

    echo "  - Generate overview synthesis"
    echo "  - Exit after Phase 1"
    ;;
  # ... 30+ lines of detailed output ...
esac
echo ""
```

**Proposed Replacement**:
```bash
# Scope detection (silent - coordinate.md displays summary)
case "$workflow_scope" in
  research-only|research-and-plan|full-implementation|debug-only)
    # Valid scope - no output
    ;;
  *)
    echo "ERROR: Unknown workflow scope: $workflow_scope" >&2
    echo "Valid scopes: research-only, research-and-plan, full-implementation, debug-only" >&2
    return 1

echo "  Summary: $summary_path"
echo ""
```

**Proposed Replacement**:
```bash
# Path pre-calculation (silent - coordinate.md displays summary)

# ... path calculation logic (unchanged) ...

# No output - coordinate.md will display workflow summary
```

**Validation**:
- [x] All informational echo statements removed
- [x] Path calculation logic unchanged
- [x] Error messages preserved (if any in this section)

#### Task 1.4: Remove Directory Creation Output

**Lines**: 215-268 (STEP 3: Directory Structure Creation)

**Actions**:
1. DELETE all echo statements from directory creation
2. KEEP directory creation logic (unchanged)
3. MAINTAIN error diagnostics on failure (stderr)

echo "════════════════════════════════════════════════════════"
echo ""
echo "Creating topic root directory at: $topic_path"
echo "   (Subdirectories created on-demand when files written)"
echo ""

# ... directory creation logic ...

echo "✅ VERIFIED: Topic root directory exists at $topic_path"
echo ""

# VERIFICATION REQUIREMENT: Confirm before proceeding
echo "Verification checkpoint passed - proceeding to artifact path calculation"
echo ""
```

**Proposed Replacement**:
```bash
# Directory creation (silent - verification occurs, no output)

# ... directory creation logic (unchanged) ...

# Verification checkpoint (silent - errors go to stderr)
```

**Validation**:
- [x] All informational echo statements removed
- [x] Directory creation logic unchanged
- [x] Error diagnostics preserved (stderr)

#### Task 1.5: Remove Final Output

**File**: `/home/benjamin/.config/.claude/lib/workflow-initialization.sh`
**Lines**: 299-352 (Final output and export section)

**Actions**:
1. DELETE "Pre-calculated Artifact Paths" listing
2. DELETE "Phase 0 Complete" message
3. KEEP all exports (unchanged)

```

**Proposed Replacement**:
```bash
# Silent completion - coordinate.md displays user-facing output
```

**Validation**:
- [x] All echo statements removed
- [x] All exports still occur (unchanged)
- [x] Return status unchanged

#### Task 1.6: Update coordinate.md to Display Workflow Summary

**File**: `/home/benjamin/.config/.claude/commands/coordinate.md`
**Lines**: ~704-708 (Phase 0 STEP 3)

**Actions**:
1. After initialize_workflow_paths call, ADD clean workflow summary
2. DISPLAY scope detection report (clean format, not bash command)
3. NO environment variables needed

**Current Code**:
```bash
# Call unified initialization function
if ! initialize_workflow_paths "$WORKFLOW_DESCRIPTION" "$WORKFLOW_SCOPE"; then
  echo "ERROR: Workflow initialization failed"
  exit 1
fi

# Reconstruct REPORT_PATHS array from exported variables
reconstruct_report_paths_array
```

**Proposed Replacement**:
```bash
# Call unified initialization function (now silent)
if ! initialize_workflow_paths "$WORKFLOW_DESCRIPTION" "$WORKFLOW_SCOPE"; then
  echo "ERROR: Workflow initialization failed"
  exit 1
fi

# Display simple workflow scope report

# Reconstruct REPORT_PATHS array from exported variables
reconstruct_report_paths_array
```

**Validation**:
- [x] Simple workflow scope report displayed
- [x] Shows which phases run vs skip (✓/✗)
- [x] No bash command visibility
- [x] Essential info shown (scope, topic, phases)

### Testing

**Test 1.1: Clean Output (Single Workflow)**

**EXECUTE NOW**:
```bash
# Run coordinate and check output
/coordinate "test workflow" > /tmp/test_clean.log 2>&1

# Verify no verbose library output
grep "Detecting workflow scope" /tmp/test_clean.log  # Expected: 0 results
grep "Pre-calculating artifact paths" /tmp/test_clean.log  # Expected: 0 results

## Phase 2: Complete Verification Format Improvements [COMPLETED]

**Objective**: Implement concise verification format (1-2 lines on success, verbose on failure)

**Priority**: High (addresses F-02)
**Complexity**: 4/10 (requires changes across 6 verification sections)
**Estimated Time**: 3-4 hours
**Risk**: Low (pattern well-defined in plan 510-001)
**Dependencies**: Phase 0 (must know current state)

### Root Cause Analysis

**Issue F-02**: MANDATORY VERIFICATION boxes still present

Evidence from output analysis:
- Lines 44-47: MANDATORY VERIFICATION - Research Reports
- Lines 57-60: MANDATORY VERIFICATION - Implementation Plan
- Plan 510-001 Phase 2 marked complete, but format not applied

**Possible Causes**:
1. Plan 510-001 Phase 2 tasks completed but not tested
2. Changes made to coordinate.md but wrong bash blocks executed
3. Documentation updated but code not modified
4. Implementation incomplete (partial work)

**Resolution**: Complete or reapply Phase 2 tasks from plan 510-001

### Standards Compliance Requirements

**MANDATORY Pattern**: Verification with Fail-Fast (.claude/docs/concepts/patterns/verification-fallback.md)

This phase implements verification checkpoints to ensure file creation succeeds on first attempt:
1. **Path Pre-Calculation** ✓ (Phase 0 already implements)
2. **Verification Checkpoints** ✓ (Task 2.2-2.5 implement concise verification)
3. **Fail-Fast on Failure** ← Focus here (identify root cause, don't use fallbacks)

**Philosophy**: Fallbacks mask root causes. Instead, focus on:
- Proper agent invocation with correct paths
- Clear behavioral injection patterns
- Immediate failure with diagnostic information
- Fix the root cause, not the symptom

**Compliance Target**:
- >95% file creation rate through proper agent invocation (not fallbacks)
- Verification at each checkpoint
- Fail-fast with diagnostics when verification fails
- Root cause fix in agent behavioral files, not fallback mechanisms

**Related Standards**:
- Standard 0: Execution Enforcement (EXECUTE NOW directives - already compliant from Revision 1)
- Standard 11: Imperative Agent Invocation (already compliant in /coordinate)
- Verification Pattern: Checkpoint verification with fail-fast diagnostics

### Tasks

#### Task 2.1: Create verify_file_created() Helper Function

**File**: `/home/benjamin/.config/.claude/commands/coordinate.md`
**Location**: After Phase 0, before Phase 1 (around line 743)

**Note**: This task is from plan 510-001 Task 2.1 (lines 248-325). Verify if function already exists via Phase 0 Task 0.1.

**Pattern Role**: This helper implements verification with fail-fast diagnostics. When verification fails, it provides detailed diagnostic information to help identify the root cause (wrong paths, permission issues, agent failures) rather than creating fallback files.

**Philosophy**: Fix the root cause, don't mask failures with fallbacks. The helper's verbose failure output helps identify:
- Path calculation errors
- Directory permission issues
- Agent invocation problems
- File creation failures

This approach leads to >95% success rates through proper agent configuration rather than relying on fallback mechanisms.

**If Function Missing**:

## Verification Helper Functions

[EXECUTION-CRITICAL: Helper functions for concise verification - defined inline for immediate availability]

The following helper functions implement concise verification with silent success and verbose failure patterns.

```bash
# verify_file_created - Concise file verification with optional verbose failure
#
# Arguments:
#   $1 - file_path (absolute path to verify)
#   $2 - item_description (e.g., "Research report 1/4")
#   $3 - phase_name (e.g., "Phase 1")
#
# Returns:
#   0 - File exists and has content (prints single ✓ character)
#   1 - File missing or empty (prints verbose diagnostic)
#
# Output:
#   Success: Single character "✓" (no newline)
#   Failure: Multi-line diagnostic with suggested actions
#
verify_file_created() {
  local file_path="$1"
  local item_desc="$2"
  local phase_name="$3"

  if [ -f "$file_path" ] && [ -s "$file_path" ]; then
    echo -n "✓"  # Success - single character, no newline
    return 0
  else
    # Failure - verbose diagnostic
    echo ""
    echo "✗ ERROR [$phase_name]: $item_desc verification failed"
    echo "   Expected: File exists at $file_path"
    [ ! -f "$file_path" ] && echo "   Found: File does not exist" || echo "   Found: File empty (0 bytes)"
    echo ""
    echo "DIAGNOSTIC INFORMATION:"
    echo "  - Expected path: $file_path"
    echo "  - Parent directory: $(dirname "$file_path")"
    echo "  - Parent exists: $([ -d "$(dirname "$file_path")" ] && echo "yes" || echo "NO")"
    echo ""
    echo "Suggested actions:"
    echo "  1. Check if agent completed successfully"
    echo "  2. Verify path calculation correct"
    echo "  3. Check parent directory permissions"
    echo "  4. Review agent output for error messages"
    echo ""
    return 1
  fi
}
```
```

**Validation**:
- [x] Function defined with correct signature
- [x] Success path prints single ✓ character
- [x] Failure path prints verbose diagnostics
- [x] Return codes correct (0 success, 1 failure)
- [x] Function implements verification with fail-fast diagnostics

#### Task 2.2: Replace Phase 1 Research Report Verification

**File**: `/home/benjamin/.config/.claude/commands/coordinate.md`
**Lines**: ~825-890 (Phase 1 verification section)

**Current Format** (if verbose):
```bash
echo "════════════════════════════════════════════════════════"
echo "  MANDATORY VERIFICATION - Research Reports"
echo "════════════════════════════════════════════════════════"
echo ""

for i in $(seq 1 $RESEARCH_COMPLEXITY); do
  REPORT_PATH="${REPORT_PATHS[$i-1]}"
  echo "Verifying Report $i: $(basename $REPORT_PATH)"

  if [ -f "$REPORT_PATH" ] && [ -s "$REPORT_PATH" ]; then
    FILE_SIZE=$(wc -c < "$REPORT_PATH")
    echo "  ✅ PASSED: Report created successfully ($FILE_SIZE bytes)"
  else
    echo "  ❌ FAILED: Report file missing or empty"
    exit 1
  fi
done

echo ""
echo "✅ ALL RESEARCH REPORTS VERIFIED SUCCESSFULLY"
echo ""
```

**Proposed Replacement**:
```bash
echo -n "Verifying research reports ($RESEARCH_COMPLEXITY): "

VERIFICATION_FAILURES=0
SUCCESSFUL_REPORT_PATHS=()
FAILED_PATHS=()

for i in $(seq 1 $RESEARCH_COMPLEXITY); do
  REPORT_PATH="${REPORT_PATHS[$i-1]}"
  if ! verify_file_created "$REPORT_PATH" "Research report $i/$RESEARCH_COMPLEXITY" "Phase 1"; then
    VERIFICATION_FAILURES=$((VERIFICATION_FAILURES + 1))
    FAILED_PATHS+=("$REPORT_PATH")
  else
    SUCCESSFUL_REPORT_PATHS+=("$REPORT_PATH")
  fi
done

if [ $VERIFICATION_FAILURES -eq 0 ]; then
  echo " (all passed)"
  emit_progress "1" "Verified: $SUCCESSFUL_REPORT_COUNT/$RESEARCH_COMPLEXITY research reports"
else
  echo ""
  echo "Workflow TERMINATED: Fix verification failures and retry"
  exit 1
fi
echo ""
```

**Verification with Fail-Fast Pattern**:

1. **Verification**: Check if file exists and has content
2. **Fail-Fast**: If verification fails, provide diagnostic information and terminate
3. **Root Cause**: Fix agent behavioral files or path calculation, don't create fallback files

**Why No Fallbacks**:
- Fallbacks mask root causes (wrong paths, broken agent invocations, permission issues)
- Better to fail immediately with clear diagnostics
- Fix the actual problem (agent behavioral files, path pre-calculation) rather than paper over it
- 95%+ success rate achievable through proper agent invocation patterns

**Diagnostic Information on Failure**:
```bash
if [ $VERIFICATION_FAILURES -gt 0 ]; then
  echo ""
  echo "✗ VERIFICATION FAILED: $VERIFICATION_FAILURES report(s) missing"
  echo ""
  echo "Failed paths:"
  for failed_path in "${FAILED_PATHS[@]}"; do
    echo "  - $failed_path"
  done
  echo ""
  echo "Root cause analysis needed:"
  echo "  1. Check if agent received correct path in prompt"
  echo "  2. Verify parent directory exists and is writable"
  echo "  3. Review agent output for error messages"
  echo "  4. Confirm behavioral injection pattern correct"
  echo ""
  echo "Fix the root cause in:"
  echo "  - Agent behavioral files (.claude/agents/)"
  echo "  - Path pre-calculation logic (Phase 0)"
  echo "  - Directory creation (Phase 0 initialization)"
  echo ""
  echo "Workflow TERMINATED - fix root cause and retry"
  exit 1
fi
```

**Expected Result**: Files created correctly on first attempt, or immediate failure with actionable diagnostics.

**Expected Output**:
```
Verifying research reports (3): ✓✓✓ (all passed)
```

**Validation**:
- [x] Single line output on success
- [x] Verbose diagnostics on failure
- [x] Token reduction ≥90% (500 → 50 tokens)

#### Task 2.3: Replace Phase 2 Plan File Verification

**File**: `/home/benjamin/.config/.claude/commands/coordinate.md`
**Lines**: ~1050-1120 (Phase 2 verification section)

echo "════════════════════════════════════════════════════════"
echo ""

if [ -f "$PLAN_PATH" ] && [ -s "$PLAN_PATH" ]; then
  PHASE_COUNT=$(grep -c "^### Phase [0-9]" "$PLAN_PATH" || echo "0")
  echo "✅ VERIFICATION PASSED: Plan created with $PHASE_COUNT phases"
  echo "   Path: $PLAN_PATH"
else
  echo "❌ VERIFICATION FAILED: Plan file missing or empty"
  exit 1
fi
echo ""
```

**Proposed Replacement**:
```bash
echo -n "Verifying implementation plan: "
if verify_file_created "$PLAN_PATH" "Implementation plan" "Phase 2"; then

echo ""
```

**Expected Output**:
```
Verifying implementation plan: ✓ (5 phases)
```

**Validation**:

**Proposed Pattern**:
```bash
echo -n "Verifying implementation artifacts: "
if [ -d "$IMPL_ARTIFACTS" ]; then
  ARTIFACT_COUNT=$(find "$IMPL_ARTIFACTS" -type f | wc -l)
  echo "✓ ($ARTIFACT_COUNT files)"
  emit_progress "3" "Implementation complete: $ARTIFACT_COUNT artifacts"
else
  echo ""
  echo "✗ ERROR: Implementation artifacts directory not created"

  exit 1
fi
echo ""
```

**Validation**:
- [x] Single line output on success
- [x] Artifact count displayed
- [x] Verbose error on failure

#### Task 2.5: Replace Remaining Verification Sections

**Files**: Same (coordinate.md)
**Sections**: Phase 4 (tests), Phase 5 (debug), Phase 6 (summary)

APPLY same concise pattern:
1. Single line: `echo -n "Verifying [item]: "`
2. CALL verify_file_created() for each file
3. PRINT result: `echo " (success info)"` or verbose error
4. EMIT progress marker

**Validation**:
- [x] All 6 verification sections updated
- [x] Consistent format throughout
- [x] Total verification output <100 tokens (down from 3,500)

### Testing

**Test 2.1: Success Path**

**EXECUTE NOW**:
```bash
/coordinate "test workflow" > /tmp/test_verify.log 2>&1

# Check for concise format
grep "Verifying.*: ✓" /tmp/test_verify.log

# Count verification output lines
grep -A 5 "Verifying" /tmp/test_verify.log | wc -l  # Target: <20 lines total

# Verify no MANDATORY VERIFICATION boxes

```

### Success Criteria

- [x] Success output MUST be reduced from 50+ lines to 1-2 lines per checkpoint
- [x] Failure output MUST remain verbose with full diagnostics
- [x] Token reduction MUST be ≥90% (3,150+ tokens saved)

## Phase 3: Standardize Progress Markers [COMPLETED]

**Objective**: Apply consistent emit_progress format throughout all phase transitions

**Priority**: Medium (addresses F-04)
**Complexity**: 1.5/10 (simple find-replace pattern)
**Estimated Time**: 1-2 hours
**Risk**: Minimal (cosmetic change only)
**Dependencies**: Phase 0 (requires emit_progress function available)

### Root Cause Analysis

**Issue F-04**: Progress marker inconsistencies

Current state:
- Mix of box-drawing headers and emit_progress calls
- Some phase transitions have markers, others don't
- Format inconsistent (some use echo, some use emit_progress)

**Target State**:
All phase transitions use emit_progress with standard format:
```
PROGRESS: [Phase N] - [action description]
```

### Tasks

#### Task 3.1: Replace Box-Drawing Phase Headers

**File**: `/home/benjamin/.config/.claude/commands/coordinate.md`
**Locations**: 7 sections (Phase 0-6 headers)

**Pattern to Find**:
```bash
echo "════════════════════════════════════════════════════════"
echo "  [PHASE HEADER TEXT]"
echo "════════════════════════════════════════════════════════"
echo ""
```

**Replacement Pattern**:
```bash
emit_progress "N" "[concise phase description]"
```

**Examples**:

**Phase 1 Header** (line ~750):
- Current: Box-drawing header "MANDATORY VERIFICATION - Research Reports"
- Proposed: `emit_progress "1" "Verifying research reports"`

**Phase 2 Header** (line ~1000):
- Current: Box-drawing header "MANDATORY VERIFICATION - Implementation Plan"
- Proposed: `emit_progress "2" "Verifying implementation plan"`

**Phase Completion** (line ~850):
- Current: `echo "Phase 1 Complete: Research artifacts verified"`
- Proposed: `emit_progress "1" "Research complete: $SUCCESSFUL_REPORT_COUNT reports created"`

**Validation**:
- [x] All 7 phase headers replaced
- [x] All box-drawing removed
- [x] Consistent format throughout

#### Task 3.2: Standardize Phase Completion Messages

**File**: `/home/benjamin/.config/.claude/commands/coordinate.md**
**Locations**: 6 sections (end of Phases 1-6)

**Pattern to Find**:
```bash
echo "Phase N Complete: [description]"
echo ""
```

**Replacement Pattern**:
```bash
emit_progress "N" "[concise completion summary]"
echo ""
```

**Examples**:

**Phase 1 Completion**:
- Current: `echo "Phase 1 Complete: Research artifacts verified"`
- Proposed: `emit_progress "1" "Research complete: verified $SUCCESSFUL_REPORT_COUNT/$RESEARCH_COMPLEXITY reports"`

**Phase 2 Completion**:
- Current: `echo "Phase 2 Complete: Implementation plan created"`
- Proposed: `emit_progress "2" "Planning complete: $PHASE_COUNT phases, $PLAN_EST_TIME estimated"`

**Validation**:
- [x] All 6 completion messages standardized
- [x] Information density maintained (key metrics included)
- [x] Format consistent

#### Task 3.3: Remove Redundant Echo Statements

**File**: `/home/benjamin/.config/.claude/commands/coordinate.md`
**Locations**: Throughout all phases

**Actions**:
1. IDENTIFY echo statements that duplicate emit_progress information
2. REMOVE redundant echoes
3. KEEP only informational echoes (data display, not progress tracking)

**Example Duplicates to Remove**:
```bash
# Redundant (duplicates emit_progress)
echo "Invoking research agents in parallel..."
emit_progress "1" "Invoking research agents in parallel"

# Keep first echo OR second emit_progress, not both
# Recommended: Keep emit_progress only
emit_progress "1" "Invoking research agents in parallel"
```

**Validation**:
- [x] No duplicate progress information
- [x] All tracking via emit_progress only
- [x] Data display echoes preserved

### Testing

**Test 3.1: Progress Marker Extraction**

**EXECUTE NOW**:
```bash
# Run coordinate and extract progress markers
/coordinate "test workflow" > /tmp/test_progress.log 2>&1
grep "PROGRESS:" /tmp/test_progress.log > progress_markers.txt

# Verify format consistent
cat progress_markers.txt | grep -v "PROGRESS: \[Phase [0-9]\]"  # Expected: 0 results

# Count markers (should be ~15-25 for full workflow)
wc -l progress_markers.txt

# Verify parseable
awk -F'PROGRESS: ' '{print $2}' progress_markers.txt  # Should extract all phases cleanly
```

**Test 3.2: Box-Drawing Removal**

**EXECUTE NOW**:
```bash
# Check for remaining box-drawing characters
grep "═" /home/benjamin/.config/.claude/commands/coordinate.md
# Expected: 0 results (or only in documentation sections, not executable code)
```

**Test 3.3: External Monitoring Script**

**EXECUTE NOW**:
```bash
# Test external parser
/coordinate "test" 2>&1 | grep "PROGRESS:" | while read line; do
  phase=$(echo "$line" | sed 's/.*\[Phase \([0-9]\)\].*/\1/')
  status=$(echo "$line" | sed 's/.*\] - \(.*\)/\1/')
  echo "Phase $phase: $status"
done

# Expected: Clean extraction of all phase transitions
```

### Success Criteria

- [x] All phase headers MUST use emit_progress
- [x] No box-drawing characters MUST remain in progress sections
- [x] Format MUST be consistent across all 7 phases
- [x] External parsing scripts MUST work correctly
- [x] Token reduction MUST be ~200 tokens (box-drawing overhead removed)

---

## Phase 4: Optional - Simplify Workflow Completion Summary

**Objective**: Reduce workflow completion summary from 53 lines to 5-8 lines

**Priority**: Low (cosmetic improvement, optional)
**Complexity**: 2/10 (simple template change)
**Estimated Time**: 1 hour
**Risk**: Minimal (only affects final summary display)
**Dependencies**: Phase 0, 1, 2 complete

### Root Cause Analysis

**Finding C**: Workflow completion summary verbose (53 lines)

Current summary includes:
- Workflow type and phases executed (5 lines)
- Artifacts created with file sizes (15 lines)
- Plan overview with metadata (8 lines)
- Key findings summary (20+ lines)
- Next steps (5 lines)

**Impact**: ~800 tokens, difficult to scan quickly

**Proposed Approach**: Two-tier summary
- Tier 1 (always show): Essential info (5-8 lines)
- Tier 2 (collapsible or separate file): Detailed findings

### Tasks

#### Task 4.1: Create Concise Summary Template

**File**: `/home/benjamin/.config/.claude/commands/coordinate.md`
**Lines**: ~1130-1180 (workflow completion section)

**Current Format**:
```bash
echo "════════════════════════════════════════════════════════"
echo "         /coordinate WORKFLOW COMPLETE"
echo "════════════════════════════════════════════════════════"
echo ""
echo "Workflow Type: $WORKFLOW_SCOPE"
echo "Phases Executed: Phase 0-2 (Location, Research, Planning)"
echo ""
echo "Artifacts Created:"
echo "  ✓ Research Reports: $SUCCESSFUL_REPORT_COUNT files"
for report in "${SUCCESSFUL_REPORT_PATHS[@]}"; do
  FILE_SIZE=$(wc -c < "$report" | numfmt --to=iec)
  echo "      - $(basename $report) ($FILE_SIZE)"
done
# ... 40+ more lines ...
```

**Proposed Concise Format**:
```bash
echo "Workflow complete: $WORKFLOW_SCOPE"
echo ""
echo "Artifacts:"
echo "  ✓ $SUCCESSFUL_REPORT_COUNT research reports"
if [ -n "$PLAN_PATH" ] && [ -f "$PLAN_PATH" ]; then
  PHASE_COUNT=$(grep -c "^### Phase [0-9]" "$PLAN_PATH" || echo "0")
  PLAN_EST=$(grep "Estimated Total Time:" "$PLAN_PATH" | head -1 | cut -d: -f2 | xargs || echo "unknown")
  echo "  ✓ 1 implementation plan ($PHASE_COUNT phases, $PLAN_EST estimated)"
fi
if [ -n "$SUMMARY_PATH" ] && [ -f "$SUMMARY_PATH" ]; then
  echo "  ✓ 1 implementation summary"
fi
echo ""
echo "Next: /implement $PLAN_PATH"
echo ""
```

**Expected Output**:
```
Workflow complete: research-and-plan

Artifacts:
  ✓ 3 research reports
  ✓ 1 implementation plan (5 phases, 3-4h estimated)

Next: /implement /path/to/plan.md
```

**Validation**:
- [ ] Output reduced from 53 lines to 5-8 lines
- [ ] Essential information preserved
- [ ] Next steps clear
- [ ] Token reduction ~700 tokens

#### Task 4.2: Create Optional Detailed Summary Function

**File**: `/home/benjamin/.config/.claude/commands/coordinate.md`
**Location**: After concise summary (optional display)

**Implementation**:
```bash
# Optional: Display detailed summary if COORDINATE_VERBOSE=true
if [ "${COORDINATE_VERBOSE:-false}" = "true" ]; then
  echo "Detailed Summary:"
  echo ""
  echo "Research Reports:"
  for report in "${SUCCESSFUL_REPORT_PATHS[@]}"; do
    FILE_SIZE=$(wc -c < "$report" | numfmt --to=iec)
    echo "  - $(basename $report) ($FILE_SIZE)"
  done
  echo ""

  if [ -n "$PLAN_PATH" ] && [ -f "$PLAN_PATH" ]; then
    echo "Plan Metadata:"
    echo "  - Complexity: $PLAN_COMPLEXITY"
    echo "  - Estimated Time: $PLAN_EST_TIME"
    echo "  - Phases: $PHASE_COUNT"
    echo ""
  fi

  # Additional detailed findings...
fi
```

**Validation**:
- [ ] Detailed summary available on demand
- [ ] Default output concise
- [ ] All information accessible (not lost)

### Testing

---

## Risk Assessment and Mitigation

### Risk 1: Breaking Existing Workflows

**Risk**: Formatting changes inadvertently break workflow logic

**Probability**: Low
**Impact**: High

**Mitigation**:
1. ONLY modify display logic, not execution logic
2. PRESERVE all conditional branches (if/else structure unchanged)
3. KEEP all verification checks intact
4. TEST all workflow types (research-only, research-and-plan, full-implementation, debug-only)

**Validation**:
- RUN regression tests after each phase
- VERIFY 100% file creation reliability maintained
- COMPARE artifact outputs before/after changes

### Risk 2: Silent Failures

**Risk**: Suppressing output hides critical error messages

**Probability**: Low
**Impact**: High

**Mitigation**:
1. NEVER suppress error messages (echo to stderr MUST be preserved)
2. MAINTAIN verbose diagnostics on ALL failures (not just some)
3. TEST error paths explicitly (simulate failures)
4. KEEP WORKFLOW_INIT_VERBOSE flag for debugging

**Validation**:
- TEST error handling with simulated failures
- VERIFY error messages visible in output
- CHECK that workflow terminates appropriately on errors

### Risk 3: Incomplete Implementation

**Risk**: Phase 0 reveals plan 510-001 incomplete, requiring more work than estimated

**Probability**: Medium
**Impact**: Medium (affects timeline only)

**Mitigation**:
1. Phase 0 WILL identify actual state before starting work
2. ADJUST plan timeline based on Phase 0 findings
3. PRIORITIZE critical fixes (F-01, F-02) over cosmetic (F-04)
4. USER MUST be informed of adjusted timeline

**Validation**:
- Phase 0 Task 0.3 WILL update plan 510-001 completion status
- Accurate assessment WILL drive realistic timeline
- User MUST approve adjusted plan before proceeding

### Risk 4: User Preference for Verbose Output

**Risk**: Users prefer detailed output, perceive concise format as "missing information"

**Probability**: Very Low
**Impact**: Low

**Mitigation**:
1. IMPLEMENT simple, clean workflow (no modes)
2. SHOW essential information in "Workflow Scope Detection"
3. USER explicitly requested simplicity (no complexity)
4. SOLICIT user feedback during testing

**Validation**:
- TEST clean output meets requirements
- VERIFY essential information displayed
- COLLECT user feedback after implementation

- Phase 0 verification step will determine actual starting state
- Timeline may adjust based on Phase 0 findings
- All formatting changes are display-only (no functional logic changes)
- Simplified approach: no verbose/silent modes (user preference)
- User feedback should be collected during testing phase
- Optional Phase 4 can be deferred if time-constrained

2. **Execute Phase 0** - Verify current state (30 minutes)
3. **Adjust timeline** - Based on Phase 0 findings
4. **Execute Phases 1-3** - Apply formatting improvements (5.5-7.5 hours)
5. **Test and validate** - Run integration and regression tests (1 hour)
6. **Optional Phase 4** - If time permits and user desires (1 hour)
7. **Document completion** - Update plan with final metrics

**Ready for implementation**: Await user approval to proceed with Phase 0.

## Revision History

### 2025-10-28 - Revision 5: Clarify Workflow Scope Report Format
**Changes**: Clarified that workflow scope report should show phases to run vs skip (not reduced to 1 line)
**Reason**: User wants simple report showing which phases run and which don't (~8-12 lines, not 71)
**Philosophy**: Show essential phase execution plan, not verbose explanations

**Modified Sections**:
- Objectives: Updated success criteria (simple phase list, not 1 line)
- Overview: Updated F-03 description (need simple report showing phases to run)
- Phase 1 Root Cause: Updated Simplified Solution (5-10 lines, shows phases to run/skip)
- Phase 1 Task 1.6: Updated Proposed Replacement (shows ✓/✗ for each phase)
- Phase 1 Testing: Updated verification checks (look for ✓/✗ phase indicators)
- Phase 1 Success Criteria: Added criteria for phase run/skip display

**Key Changes**:
- Task 1.6 output format: Shows "Phases to Execute:" with ✓ (run) and ✗ (skip) indicators
- Target output: 8-12 lines (not 1 line, not 71 lines)
- Phase-specific display: Different phase lists for research-only, research-and-plan, full-implementation, debug-only

**Example Output**:
```
Workflow Scope: research-and-plan
Topic: /path/to/topic

Phases to Execute:
  ✓ Phase 0: Initialization
  ✓ Phase 1: Research (parallel agents)
  ✓ Phase 2: Planning
  ✗ Phase 3: Implementation (skipped)
```

**No Changes To**:
- Phase 0, 2, 3, 4 structure or content
- Timeline or complexity estimates
- Library silencing approach (still remove all echo statements)
- Overall plan structure

### 2025-10-28 - Revision 4: Simplify Workflow (Remove Verbose/Default Modes)
**Changes**: Removed all verbose/default mode complexity, simplified to single clean workflow
**Reason**: User preference for simplicity without needless complexity
**Philosophy**: Libraries MUST be silent, commands display output, no environment variables needed

**Modified Sections**:
- Phase 1 Tasks 1.1-1.6: Changed from "suppress with flag" to "remove all echo statements"
- Phase 1 Testing: Removed verbose mode tests, simplified to single clean output test
- Phase 1 Success Criteria: Removed WORKFLOW_INIT_VERBOSE references
- Risk 4: Updated to reflect simplified approach (no modes)
- Deliverables: Removed "user documentation for verbose mode"
- Notes: Updated to reflect simplification

**Key Changes**:
- Task 1.1: Remove all echo statements (not "add verbose flag")
- Task 1.2: Delete scope output (not "wrap in conditional")
- Task 1.3: Delete path output (not "suppress with flag")
- Task 1.4: Delete directory output (not "wrap in conditional")
- Task 1.5: Delete final output (not "suppress with flag")
- Task 1.6: Display simple workflow scope report (showing phases to run/skip)
- Testing: Single workflow test (not separate verbose/silent tests)

**No Changes To**:
- Phase 0, 2, 3, 4 structure or content
- Timeline or complexity estimates
- Overall plan structure
- Phase 2 verification format improvements
- Phase 3 progress marker standardization

### 2025-10-28 - Revision 1: Standards Compliance
**Changes**: Updated language to comply with Command Architecture Standards (Standard 0: Execution Enforcement)
**Reason**: Ensure imperative language for all required actions, add execution markers for critical operations
**Standards Applied**:
- Imperative Language Guide (.claude/docs/guides/imperative-language-guide.md)
- Command Architecture Standards (.claude/docs/reference/command_architecture_standards.md#standard-0)
- Verification-Fallback Pattern (.claude/docs/concepts/patterns/verification-fallback.md)

**Modified Sections**:
- All task descriptions: Replaced "should"/"can" with "MUST"/"WILL"
- Bash code blocks: Added "EXECUTE NOW" markers where missing
- Verification sections: Confirmed MANDATORY VERIFICATION pattern compliance (already correct)
- Actions lists: Changed descriptive to imperative language
- Success criteria: Updated all criteria to use imperative language
- Risk mitigation: Updated all mitigation steps to use imperative language
- Testing procedures: Added "EXECUTE NOW" markers to all test bash blocks

**No Changes To**:
- Plan structure or phase organization
- Technical content or code examples
- Timeline or complexity estimates
- Testing strategy or success criteria content
- MANDATORY VERIFICATION sections (already compliant with pattern)

### 2025-10-28 - Revision 2: Verification-Fallback Pattern Completion
**Changes**: Enhanced Phase 2 to implement complete Verification-Fallback pattern based on plan 512-001
**Reason**: Plan 512-001 demonstrated that 33% → 100% pattern compliance is required for MANDATORY standards
**Reference Plan**: 512-001 (lines 175-248: Full Verification-Fallback pattern implementation)

**Modified Sections**:
- Phase 2 Task 2.2: Added fallback mechanism example and 3-step pattern documentation
- Phase 2: Added Standards Compliance Requirements section
- Phase 2 Success Criteria: Added fallback + re-verification requirements
- Phase 2 Task 2.1: Clarified helper function role in pattern (verification only, not fallback)

**Pattern Completion**:
- Step 1 (Verification): Already implemented via verify_file_created() helper
- Step 2 (Fallback): NOW REQUIRED - create files from agent output when verification fails
- Step 3 (Re-verification): Already implemented via verify_file_created() diagnostics

**No Changes To**:
- Phase 0, 1, 3, 4 structure or content
- Timeline or complexity estimates
- Testing strategy approach
- EXECUTE NOW directives (already compliant)

### 2025-10-28 - Revision 3: Fail-Fast Philosophy (Avoid Fallbacks)
**Changes**: Removed fallback mechanisms in favor of fail-fast approach with diagnostic information
**Reason**: User preference to avoid fallbacks whenever possible; focus on fixing root causes rather than masking failures
**Philosophy**: Fallbacks mask root causes. Better to fail immediately with clear diagnostics and fix the actual problem (agent behavioral files, path calculation) rather than create fallback files.

**Modified Sections**:
- Phase 2 Standards Compliance: Changed from "Verification-Fallback" to "Verification with Fail-Fast"
- Phase 2 Task 2.2: Removed fallback example, added fail-fast diagnostic pattern
- Phase 2 Task 2.1: Updated Pattern Role to emphasize fail-fast over fallbacks
- Phase 2 Success Criteria: Changed from "100% via fallback" to ">95% via proper invocation"
- Overview: Updated success criteria to emphasize proper agent invocation

**Key Changes**:
- Removed all fallback file creation logic
- Added comprehensive diagnostic output on verification failure
- Emphasize fixing root causes (agent files, paths) over masking failures
- Target >95% success through proper configuration, not fallbacks

**No Changes To**:
- Phase 0, 1, 3, 4 structure or content
- Timeline or complexity estimates
- Testing strategy approach
- EXECUTE NOW directives (already compliant)
- Concise verification format (1-2 lines on success)
- Previous revision history entries (append, don't replace)
