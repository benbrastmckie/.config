# Research Report: Performance Bottlenecks and Bloat Identification

## Executive Summary
[To be completed after research]

## Research Objectives
- Analyze /research command for code bloat, redundancy, and unused features
- Identify verification overhead and potential streamlining opportunities
- Examine agent invocation patterns for inefficiencies
- Compare with recently optimized /supervise command
- Assess context usage and token efficiency

## Methodology
- Static code analysis of command files
- Comparison with optimized commands in codebase
- Identification of redundant patterns and unused code paths

## Findings
[Research in progress...]

## Optimization Recommendations
[To be completed after analysis]
