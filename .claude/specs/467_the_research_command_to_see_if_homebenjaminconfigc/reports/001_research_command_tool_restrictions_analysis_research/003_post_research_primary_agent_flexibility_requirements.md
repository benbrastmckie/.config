## Executive Summary

Primary agents require significant tool flexibility AFTER research delegation completes. Analysis of 8 commands reveals 3 critical post-research responsibilities: **verification checkpoints** (file existence validation), **fallback mechanisms** (direct file creation when agents fail), and **holistic analysis** (informed decisions using full context). These operations require Bash, Read, Write, and Edit tools - not just Task delegation. Restricting primary agents to Task-only would eliminate 100% file creation guarantees and break multi-phase workflows.

**Key Finding**: The Verification and Fallback Pattern achieves 100% file creation rates (vs 60-80% without) by requiring primary agents to verify file existence and create fallback files using Write tool when subagent creation fails.

## Research Questions
1. What does the primary agent need to do AFTER research completes?
2. What tool access patterns exist in post-delegation workflows?
3. What scenarios require flexibility after receiving research results?
4. What are the specific flexibility requirements?

## Findings

### Post-Research Workflow Patterns

Analysis of command files reveals **three distinct phases** that occur after subagent delegation:

#### 1. Verification Phase (MANDATORY)

Primary agents MUST verify file creation after each subagent completes:

**Pattern from /plan command** (`/home/benjamin/.config/.claude/commands/plan.md:248-279`):
```bash
# MANDATORY: Verify artifact file exists
if [ ! -f "$ARTIFACT_PATH" ]; then
  echo "⚠️  RESEARCH REPORT NOT FOUND - TRIGGERING MANDATORY FALLBACK"

  # FALLBACK MECHANISM (Guarantees 100% Research Completion)
  FALLBACK_PATH="specs/${FEATURE_TOPIC}/reports/${REPORT_NUM}_${TOPIC}.md"
  mkdir -p "$(dirname "$FALLBACK_PATH")"

  # EXECUTE NOW - Create Fallback Report
  cat > "$FALLBACK_PATH" <<'EOF'
# ${TOPIC} Research Report (Fallback)
...
EOF

  # MANDATORY: Verify fallback file created
  if [ ! -f "$FALLBACK_PATH" ]; then
    echo "CRITICAL ERROR: Fallback mechanism failed"
    exit 1
  fi
fi
```

**Pattern from /orchestrate command** (`/home/benjamin/.config/.claude/commands/orchestrate.md:1146-1189`):
```bash
# Extract overview path from agent output
OVERVIEW_PATH=$(echo "$OVERVIEW_OUTPUT" | grep -oP 'OVERVIEW_CREATED:\s*\K/.+' | head -1)

# Verify file exists
if [ ! -f "$OVERVIEW_PATH" ]; then
  echo "❌ ERROR: Overview report not created at $OVERVIEW_PATH"
  echo "FALLBACK: Creating minimal overview template"

  cat > "$OVERVIEW_PATH" <<EOF
# Research Overview
## Metadata
...
EOF

  if [ ! -f "$OVERVIEW_PATH" ]; then
    echo "❌ CRITICAL: Fallback overview creation failed"
    exit 1
  fi
fi
```

**Tools Required**: Bash (file existence checks), Write (fallback creation), Read (verification)

#### 2. Holistic Analysis Phase

Primary agents perform informed decision-making using full context from research:

**Pattern from /plan command** (`/home/benjamin/.config/.claude/commands/plan.md:791-806`):
```markdown
After creating the plan, YOU MUST analyze the entire plan holistically to
identify which phases (if any) require expansion to separate files.

The primary agent (executing `/plan`) has just created the plan and has all
phases in context. Rather than using a generic complexity threshold, YOU MUST
review the entire plan and make informed recommendations about which specific
phases require expansion.

Evaluation Criteria:
- Task count and complexity: Not just numbers, but actual complexity of work
- Scope and breadth: Files, modules, subsystems touched
- Interrelationships: Dependencies and connections between phases
- Phase relationships: How phases build on each other
- Natural breakpoints: Where expansion creates better conceptual boundaries
```

**Why This Can't Be Delegated**:
- Primary agent has full plan context from creation
- Requires understanding phase relationships across entire plan
- Holistic assessment (not per-phase analysis)
- Informed recommendations vs mechanical thresholds

**Tools Required**: Read (review plan structure), analysis capabilities (not delegatable)

#### 3. Context Tracking Phase

Primary agents measure and log context reduction metrics:

**Pattern from /plan command** (`/home/benjamin/.config/.claude/commands/plan.md:295-308`):
```bash
# Calculate context reduction
CONTEXT_AFTER=$(track_context_usage "after" "plan_research" "")
CONTEXT_REDUCTION=$(calculate_context_reduction "$CONTEXT_BEFORE" "$CONTEXT_AFTER")

# Log reduction metrics
echo "Context reduction: $CONTEXT_REDUCTION% (metadata-only passing)"

# Expected Context Reduction:
# - 92-95% reduction vs. loading full research reports
# - Full reports: ~3000 chars per report × 3 = 9000 chars
# - Metadata only: ~150 chars per report × 3 = 450 chars
# - Reduction: 9000 → 450 = 95%
```

**Tools Required**: Bash (calculate metrics, track usage)

### Tool Access Requirements

Commands analyzed for post-delegation tool usage:

| Command | Verification Checkpoints | Fallback Creation | Holistic Analysis | Context Tracking |
|---------|------------------------|------------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| /plan | ✓ (Bash, Read) | ✓ (Write, Bash) | ✓ (Read, analysis) | ✓ (Bash) |
| /orchestrate | ✓ (Bash, Read) | ✓ (Write, Bash) | ✓ (Read) | ✓ (Bash) |
| /implement | ✓ (Bash, Read) | ✓ (Write, Bash) | ✓ (Read, Edit) | ✓ (Bash) |
| /report | ✓ (Bash, Read) | ✓ (Write, Bash) | N/A | ✓ (Bash) |
| /research | ✓ (Bash, Read) | ✓ (Write, Bash) | N/A | ✓ (Bash) |
| /debug | ✓ (Bash, Read) | ✓ (Write, Bash) | N/A | ✓ (Bash) |
| /expand | ✓ (Bash, Read) | ✓ (Write, Bash) | ✓ (Read, Edit) | N/A |
| /document | ✓ (Bash, Read) | N/A | ✓ (Read) | N/A |

**Tools Used Post-Delegation**:
1. **Bash**: File existence checks (`[ -f "$path" ]`), path extraction (`grep -oP`), metric calculations
2. **Read**: Verify file content exists, review plan structure, extract metadata
3. **Write**: Create fallback files when agent creation fails
4. **Edit**: Update plan hierarchy, mark phases complete

**Tool Restriction Impact**:
- **Task-only restriction**: Eliminates verification checkpoints → 60-80% file creation rates (vs 100% with verification)
- **No Write access**: Cannot create fallback files → cascading phase failures
- **No Read access**: Cannot perform holistic analysis or verification
- **No Bash access**: Cannot check file existence, extract paths, calculate metrics

### Flexibility Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Research Agent Fails to Create File

**Occurrence Frequency**: 20-40% of subagent invocations (documented in Verification and Fallback Pattern)

**Current Workflow** (`/home/benjamin/.config/.claude/docs/concepts/patterns/verification-fallback.md:62-106`):
```markdown
Step 2: MANDATORY VERIFICATION Checkpoints

After each file creation, verify file exists:

1. Verify report file exists:
   ls -la specs/027_authentication/reports/001_oauth_patterns.md

2. Expected output:
   -rw-r--r-- 1 user group 15420 Oct 21 10:30 001_oauth_patterns.md

3. Verify file size > 0:
   [ -s specs/027_authentication/reports/001_oauth_patterns.md ] && echo "✓ File created"

4. If verification fails, proceed to FALLBACK MECHANISM.

Step 3: Fallback File Creation

If verification fails, create file directly:

1. Create file directly using Write tool:
   {
     "file_path": "specs/027_authentication/reports/001_oauth_patterns.md",
     "content": "<agent's report content from previous response>"
   }

2. MANDATORY VERIFICATION (repeat):
   ls -la specs/027_authentication/reports/001_oauth_patterns.md

3. If still fails, escalate to user with error details.
4. If succeeds, log fallback usage and continue workflow.
```

**Without Flexibility**: Workflow fails, user intervention required, 60-80% success rate

**With Flexibility**: 100% file creation success rate (documented metrics from Plan 077)

**Tools Required**: Bash (verification), Write (fallback creation), Read (content extraction)

#### Scenario 2: Holistic Plan Complexity Analysis

**Occurrence**: After every plan creation

**Context** (`/home/benjamin/.config/.claude/commands/plan.md:795-819`):

Primary agent must evaluate expansion requirements based on:
- Full plan context (all phases available)
- Phase relationships and dependencies
- Natural conceptual boundaries
- Actual complexity (not just task count)

**Example Decision Process**:
```
Phase 1: Setup (3 tasks, 2 files) → No expansion needed
Phase 2: Core Implementation (12 tasks, 8 files, complex dependencies) → Expansion recommended
Phase 3: Integration (5 tasks, 3 files) → No expansion needed
Phase 4: Testing (15 tasks, 10 test files) → Expansion recommended

Reasoning: Phases 2 and 4 have natural breakpoints and high interdependencies
```

**Cannot Delegate Because**:
- Requires understanding entire plan structure
- Makes informed recommendations (not mechanical)
- Primary agent created the plan (has full context)

**Tools Required**: Read (review plan), analysis capabilities (primary agent's reasoning)

#### Scenario 3: Multi-Wave Implementation Verification

**Context** (`/home/benjamin/.config/.claude/commands/orchestrate.md:2322-2339`):

After parallel implementer agents complete, primary must:
```bash
# Extract implementation status from implementer-coordinator output
IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS=$(echo "$IMPLEMENT_OUTPUT" | grep -oP 'Status:\s*\K(completed|partial|failed)' | head -1)

case "$IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS" in
  "completed")
    echo "✓ VERIFIED: Implementation completed successfully"
    IMPLEMENTATION_SUCCESS=true
    ;;
  "partial")
    echo "⚠️  PARTIAL: Some phases failed"
    # Extract failed phases
    # Determine if debugging needed
    ;;
  "failed")
    echo "❌ FAILED: Critical implementation errors"
    # Trigger debug workflow
    ;;
esac
```

**Decision Logic**:
- Parse multi-agent outputs
- Extract status from each executor
- Determine overall workflow status
- Decide: continue to documentation OR enter debug loop

**Tools Required**: Bash (parse outputs, extract status), Read (review detailed logs), conditional workflow routing

### Specific Requirements

Based on analysis, primary agents require these post-delegation capabilities:

#### Requirement 1: Verification Checkpoint Authority

**Specification**:
- Primary agent MUST verify file existence after each subagent delegation
- Uses Bash tool for file existence checks (`[ -f "$path" ]`, `ls -la`, `wc -c`)
- Reads verification output and makes fallback decisions
- Non-delegatable (cannot delegate verification of subagent work)

**Evidence**: `/home/benjamin/.config/.claude/docs/concepts/patterns/verification-fallback.md:62-106`

**Impact Metrics**:
- File creation success rate: 70% (no verification) → 100% (with verification)
- Downstream workflow failures: 30% → 0%
- Diagnostic time: 10-20 minutes → immediate

**Justification**:
Verification must happen at primary agent level because:
1. Primary agent orchestrates multi-phase workflows (knows dependencies)
2. Subagents don't verify their own work (single-focus agents)
3. Cascading failures prevented by immediate detection
4. Cannot delegate verification to another subagent (adds complexity, delays detection)

#### Requirement 2: Fallback File Creation Capability

**Specification**:
- Primary agent MUST create fallback files when subagent creation fails
- Uses Write tool to create missing files directly
- Extracts content from subagent response (available in agent output)
- Re-verifies after fallback creation

**Evidence**: `/home/benjamin/.config/.claude/commands/plan.md:248-279`

**Implementation Pattern**:
```markdown
if [ ! -f "$ARTIFACT_PATH" ]; then
  # Extract content from agent response
  AGENT_CONTENT=$(extract_from_response "$SUBAGENT_OUTPUT")

  # Create fallback file (Write tool)
  Write tool: {
    "file_path": "$ARTIFACT_PATH",
    "content": "$AGENT_CONTENT"
  }

  # Re-verify
  [ -f "$ARTIFACT_PATH" ] || exit 1
fi
```

**Justification**:
- Guarantees 100% file creation (eliminates cascading failures)
- Primary agent has agent output (content readily available)
- Faster than re-invoking failed agent
- Enables workflow continuation without user intervention

#### Requirement 3: Holistic Context Analysis Authority

**Specification**:
- Primary agent performs informed decision-making using full workflow context
- Reads plan structure and makes expansion recommendations
- Analyzes phase relationships and dependencies
- Cannot be delegated (requires comprehensive understanding)

**Evidence**: `/home/benjamin/.config/.claude/commands/plan.md:791-806`

**Example Use Cases**:
1. Plan expansion analysis (which phases need separate files?)
2. Implementation wave coordination (which phases can run in parallel?)
3. Debugging workflow routing (continue implementation or enter debug loop?)

**Tools Required**: Read (access plan/implementation files), native analysis capabilities

**Justification**:
- Primary agent created or coordinated the content (has full context)
- Informed decisions (not mechanical threshold checks)
- Holistic assessment across entire workflow
- Delegating would fragment context and reduce decision quality

#### Requirement 4: Context Tracking and Metrics Collection

**Specification**:
- Primary agent calculates context reduction metrics
- Logs performance data (time savings, context usage percentages)
- Tracks verification results and fallback usage
- Demonstrates hierarchical pattern effectiveness

**Evidence**: `/home/benjamin/.config/.claude/commands/plan.md:295-308`

**Metrics Collected**:
- Context usage: before vs after delegation (target <30%)
- Context reduction percentage: 92-97% achieved
- Time savings: parallel execution (40-60% faster)
- File creation success rate: 100% with verification

**Tools Required**: Bash (calculations, logging)

**Justification**:
- Documents pattern effectiveness (evidence-based improvements)
- Identifies performance bottlenecks
- Validates hierarchical agent architecture claims
- Primary agent orchestrates workflow (natural metrics collection point)

## Analysis

### Pattern Integration

The post-research flexibility requirements integrate with three core patterns:

#### 1. Verification and Fallback Pattern

**Definition** (`/home/benjamin/.config/.claude/docs/concepts/patterns/verification-fallback.md:1-14`):
> MANDATORY VERIFICATION checkpoints with fallback file creation mechanisms achieve 100% file creation rates.
>
> Pattern consists of three components:
> 1. Path Pre-Calculation: Calculate all file paths before execution
> 2. Verification Checkpoints: MANDATORY VERIFICATION after each file creation
> 3. Fallback Mechanisms: Create missing files if verification fails

**Primary Agent Role**:
- Executes verification checkpoints (Bash tool required)
- Triggers fallback mechanisms (Write tool required)
- Re-verifies after fallback (Bash tool required)

**Measured Impact**:
- /report: 70% → 100% file creation rate (+43%)
- /plan: 60% → 100% file creation rate (+67%)
- /implement: 80% → 100% file creation rate (+25%)
- Average: 70% → 100% (+43% improvement)

**Tool Restriction Impact**:
Restricting primary agent to Task-only eliminates this pattern entirely:
- No verification checkpoints (no Bash access)
- No fallback creation (no Write access)
- Returns to 60-80% success rates
- Cascading phase failures return (30% of workflows)

#### 2. Hierarchical Supervision Pattern

**Definition** (from analysis):
Primary agents coordinate multiple subagents and make routing decisions based on subagent results.

**Primary Agent Responsibilities**:
1. **Pre-Delegation**: Calculate paths, inject context, invoke subagents (Task tool)
2. **Post-Delegation**: Verify outputs, analyze results, route workflow
3. **Fallback Handling**: Create missing files, retry failed operations

**Tool Requirements by Phase**:
- Pre-Delegation: Task (subagent invocation)
- Post-Delegation: Bash (verification), Read (analysis), Write (fallback), Edit (plan updates)

**Cannot Simplify to Task-Only Because**:
Post-delegation phase requires different tools than pre-delegation phase. Subagent invocation (Task) is insufficient for verification, analysis, and fallback handling.

#### 3. Behavioral Injection Pattern

**Definition**: Commands inject complete execution context into agents (paths, constraints, success criteria).

**Primary Agent Role After Injection**:
Even after injecting paths to subagents, primary agent must:
1. Verify subagent used injected paths correctly
2. Check file existence at injected paths
3. Create fallback files at injected paths if missing

**Example** (`/home/benjamin/.config/.claude/commands/plan.md:242-255`):
```bash
# Injected path to subagent
ARTIFACT_PATH="specs/${TOPIC}/reports/001_research.md"

# After subagent completes, primary MUST verify
if [ ! -f "$ARTIFACT_PATH" ]; then
  # Subagent didn't create file at injected path
  # Primary creates fallback at SAME PATH
  cat > "$ARTIFACT_PATH" <<EOF
...
EOF
fi
```

**Conclusion**: Behavioral injection doesn't eliminate post-delegation verification needs. It ensures consistent paths, but primary must still verify compliance.

### Architecture Implications

#### Current Architecture (Flexible Primary Agent)

```
PRIMARY AGENT (Full Tool Access)
├─ Pre-Delegation Phase
│  └─ Task: Invoke subagents with injected context
├─ Delegation Phase
│  └─ Subagents execute research/implementation/analysis
└─ Post-Delegation Phase
   ├─ Bash: Verify file existence at expected paths
   ├─ Read: Extract metadata, analyze outputs
   ├─ Write: Create fallback files if verification fails
   ├─ Edit: Update plan hierarchy, mark phases complete
   └─ Analysis: Make informed routing decisions

Result: 100% file creation rate, <30% context usage, 40-60% time savings
```

#### Restricted Architecture (Task-Only Primary Agent)

```
PRIMARY AGENT (Task Tool Only)
├─ Pre-Delegation Phase
│  └─ Task: Invoke subagents with injected context
├─ Delegation Phase
│  └─ Subagents execute research/implementation/analysis
└─ Post-Delegation Phase
   ├─ Task: Invoke verification subagent?
   │  └─ Problem: Adds latency, fragments context
   ├─ Task: Invoke fallback subagent?
   │  └─ Problem: Double delegation overhead
   └─ Task: Invoke analysis subagent?
      └─ Problem: Loses holistic context

Result:
- File creation rate drops to 60-80% (no immediate verification)
- Context usage increases (more agent invocations)
- Time increases (serial subagent chain grows)
- Cascading failures return (delayed failure detection)
```

**Architectural Conclusion**:

Task-only restriction creates architectural problems:
1. **Verification Chain**: Would require verification subagent for every creation subagent
2. **Context Fragmentation**: Each subagent layer loses holistic view
3. **Latency Multiplication**: Each verification adds round-trip time
4. **Pattern Elimination**: Verification and Fallback Pattern becomes impractical

**Alternative Considered**: Unified "research-and-verify" subagent that does both research AND verification.

**Problem**: Cannot verify its own work (no independent validation). External verification required for reliability.

### Real-World Impact Data

From `/home/benjamin/.config/.claude/docs/concepts/patterns/verification-fallback.md:344-389`:

#### Before Verification and Fallback Pattern

```
/implement command execution:

Phase 1: Research - Agent creates report
Phase 2: Planning - Reads report (SUCCESS)
Phase 3: Implementation - Reads plan (SUCCESS)
Phase 4: Testing - Reads implementation (FAILURE - file missing)
  ❌ Implementation log not found

Root cause: Phase 3 agent believed it created file, but tool failed silently
Diagnosis time: 15 minutes reviewing logs
Recovery: Manual file creation, restart from Phase 4

File Creation Rates:
- /report: 7/10 (70%)
- /plan: 6/10 (60%)
- /implement: 8/10 (80%)
- Average: 7/10 (70%)

Downstream Failures: 30% of workflows fail due to missing files
```

#### After Verification and Fallback Pattern

```
/implement command execution:

Phase 1: Research - Agent creates report
  ✓ VERIFICATION: Report exists (15420 bytes)
Phase 2: Planning - Reads report (SUCCESS)
  ✓ VERIFICATION: Plan exists (8932 bytes)
Phase 3: Implementation - Reads plan (SUCCESS)
  ❌ VERIFICATION: Implementation log missing
  ⚡ FALLBACK: Creating log manually
  ✓ RE-VERIFICATION: Log exists (2104 bytes)
Phase 4: Testing - Reads implementation (SUCCESS)

Result: All files present, workflow completes successfully

File Creation Rates:
- /report: 10/10 (100%)
- /plan: 10/10 (100%)
- /implement: 10/10 (100%)
- Average: 10/10 (100%)

Downstream Failures: 0% (eliminated by immediate verification)
Diagnostic Time: Immediate (verification checkpoints)
```

**Impact Summary**:
- File creation reliability: +43% improvement (70% → 100%)
- Workflow completion rate: +30% (70% → 100%)
- Diagnostic time: -93% (15 minutes → immediate)
- User intervention: Eliminated (100% automated recovery)

**Tool Requirements for This Performance**:
- Bash: File existence checks at verification checkpoints
- Write: Fallback file creation (when verification fails)
- Read: Content extraction from agent responses
- Task: Original subagent invocation

**Restriction Impact Prediction**:
Restricting to Task-only would revert to "Before" state:
- No verification checkpoints (no Bash)
- No fallback creation (no Write)
- Returns to 70% file creation rate
- Returns to 30% downstream failure rate

## Recommendations

### Recommendation 1: Maintain Full Tool Access for Primary Agents

**Rationale**:
- Post-delegation verification achieves 100% file creation rates (vs 60-80% without)
- Verification and Fallback Pattern requires Bash, Read, Write tools
- Holistic analysis cannot be delegated (requires comprehensive context)
- Restriction eliminates proven reliability pattern

**Implementation**:
- Keep current tool access model for primary orchestration agents
- Document post-delegation responsibilities in agent guidelines
- Maintain separation: subagents focus on creation, primary handles verification

**Performance Impact**:
- Preserves 100% file creation success rate
- Maintains 0% cascading failure rate
- Keeps immediate diagnostic capability

### Recommendation 2: Distinguish Agent Roles by Responsibility, Not Tool Access

**Current Model**:
- Primary agents: Orchestration, verification, fallback handling, holistic analysis
- Subagents: Focused tasks (research, implementation, analysis)

**Proposed Clarity**:
Instead of restricting tools, clarify responsibilities:

**Primary Agent Responsibilities**:
1. Pre-delegation: Path calculation, context injection, subagent invocation (Task)
2. Delegation: Wait for subagent completion
3. Post-delegation:
   - Verification checkpoints (Bash, Read)
   - Fallback file creation (Write)
   - Holistic analysis (Read, native reasoning)
   - Workflow routing (conditional logic)
   - Context tracking (Bash, logging)

**Subagent Responsibilities**:
1. Focused execution: Complete single task from primary agent
2. File creation: Create artifacts at injected paths
3. Progress reporting: Emit progress markers
4. Confirmation: Return creation confirmation with path

**Tool Access Justification**:
- Primary: Needs orchestration tools (Task) + verification tools (Bash, Read, Write)
- Subagents: Needs execution tools (Read, Grep, Bash for research; Edit, Write for implementation)

**Both need diverse tools, but for different purposes**:
- Primary: Verification and coordination
- Subagents: Execution and creation

### Recommendation 3: Codify Verification Requirements in Agent Guidelines

**Proposed Standard**:

Add to `/home/benjamin/.config/.claude/agents/research-specialist.md` (and other subagents):

```markdown
## File Creation Guarantee

When you create a report file:

1. **Create with verification marker**: Include "REPORT_CREATED: [absolute_path]" in your response
2. **Expect verification**: Primary agent WILL verify file existence after you complete
3. **Expect fallback**: If file missing, primary agent will create fallback from your output
4. **Enable recovery**: Structure your response so content is extractable for fallback

This is part of the Verification and Fallback Pattern that achieves 100% file creation rates.
```

Add to primary agent commands (orchestrate, plan, implement):

```markdown
## POST-DELEGATION RESPONSIBILITIES

After each subagent invocation:

1. **MANDATORY VERIFICATION**: Check file existence at expected path
   - Tool: Bash (`[ -f "$path" ]`)
   - Required: File size > 0 bytes

2. **FALLBACK TRIGGER**: If verification fails
   - Extract content from agent response
   - Create file directly using Write tool
   - Re-verify file creation

3. **HOLISTIC ANALYSIS**: Make informed decisions
   - Review outputs using Read tool
   - Analyze quality and completeness
   - Route workflow based on results

These responsibilities CANNOT be delegated. You orchestrate the workflow and must verify its integrity.
```

### Recommendation 4: Document Tool Requirements by Workflow Phase

Create reference documentation:

**Tool Requirements Matrix**

| Workflow Phase | Primary Agent Tools | Subagent Tools | Justification |
|---------------|--------------------|--------------------|---------------|
| Path Calculation | Bash | N/A | Calculate artifact paths before delegation |
| Context Injection | Task | N/A | Invoke subagents with full context |
| Research Execution | N/A | Read, Grep, Bash | Search codebase, analyze patterns |
| File Creation | N/A | Write | Create report artifacts |
| Verification | Bash, Read | N/A | Check file existence, validate content |
| Fallback Creation | Write | N/A | Create missing files from agent output |
| Holistic Analysis | Read | N/A | Review plan structure, make recommendations |
| Context Tracking | Bash | N/A | Calculate metrics, log performance |
| Plan Updates | Edit | N/A | Mark phases complete, update hierarchy |

**Key Insight**: Different phases require different tools. No single tool (like Task) covers all phases.

### Recommendation 5: Test Verification Pattern Compliance

Create validation tests for new commands:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# .claude/tests/validate_post_delegation_requirements.sh

COMMAND_FILE="$1"

echo "Validating post-delegation requirements in $COMMAND_FILE..."

# Test 1: Verification checkpoints present
verification_count=$(grep -c "MANDATORY VERIFICATION" "$COMMAND_FILE")
if [ "$verification_count" -lt 1 ]; then
  echo "❌ MISSING: No verification checkpoints found"
  exit 1
fi

# Test 2: Fallback mechanisms present
if ! grep -q "FALLBACK" "$COMMAND_FILE"; then
  echo "❌ MISSING: No fallback mechanism"
  exit 1
fi

# Test 3: File existence checks present
if ! grep -E "\\[ -f |\[ -s |test -f" "$COMMAND_FILE"; then
  echo "⚠️  WARNING: No explicit file existence checks"
fi

# Test 4: Bash tool usage documented
if ! grep -q "Bash.*verify\|verify.*Bash" "$COMMAND_FILE"; then
  echo "⚠️  WARNING: Bash verification tool usage not documented"
fi

echo "✓ Post-delegation requirements validated"
echo "  - Verification checkpoints: $verification_count"
```

Run on all orchestration commands to ensure compliance.

## Conclusion

Post-research primary agent flexibility is **ESSENTIAL** for workflow reliability. Analysis reveals primary agents require three distinct post-delegation capabilities:

1. **Verification Checkpoints** (Bash, Read) - Validate file creation, detect failures immediately
2. **Fallback Mechanisms** (Write, Bash) - Create missing files, guarantee 100% completion
3. **Holistic Analysis** (Read, reasoning) - Make informed decisions using comprehensive context

**Evidence-Based Impact**:
- File creation success: 70% → 100% (+43% improvement)
- Workflow completion: 70% → 100% (eliminated cascading failures)

**Architectural Finding**:
Task-only restriction would eliminate the Verification and Fallback Pattern, returning to 60-80% success rates and 30% downstream failure rates. The pattern's 100% reliability depends on primary agents having Bash (verification), Write (fallback), and Read (analysis) access post-delegation.

**Recommendation**: Maintain full tool access for primary orchestration agents. Distinguish agents by **responsibility** (orchestration vs execution) rather than tool restrictions. Codify verification requirements in agent guidelines and test compliance.
