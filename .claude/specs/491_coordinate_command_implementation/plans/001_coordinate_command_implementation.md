## Overview

Create a new `/coordinate` command that provides clean, economical multi-agent workflow orchestration by combining the best elements of `/supervise` (proven 95% architectural compliance, clean 2,177-line structure) with `/orchestrate`'s wave-based parallel implementation (40-60% time savings), while maintaining reasonable file size (target: 2,500-3,000 lines) and fixing all identified standards violations.

The command will orchestrate end-to-end development workflows (research → plan → implement → test → debug → document) using behavioral injection pattern, metadata extraction for context reduction, and imperative agent invocation without code-fenced examples.

## Research Summary

**From Report 489 (Claude Code Subagents Documentation)**:
- Code-fenced Task examples cause 0% agent delegation due to priming effect
- Hierarchical agent architecture achieves 92-97% context reduction through metadata extraction
- Behavioral injection pattern critical for agent delegation (imperative language required)
- Clear error messages and debugging more valuable than complex retry mechanisms

**From Report 490 (/supervise Command Analysis)**:
- /supervise has 95% architectural compliance but lacks wave-based parallel execution (40-60% performance gap)
- Three minor standards violations: behavioral duplication (250 lines), missing imperative markers (2 instances), code-fenced anti-pattern example
- 90-95% functional overlap between /supervise and /orchestrate
- /supervise is cleaner (2,177 lines) vs /orchestrate (5,438 lines) but sequential-only
- Wave-based implementation is the critical missing feature

**Recommended Approach**:
Start from /supervise's proven architecture, add wave-based implementation for Phase 3 only, fix three violations, use clear error messages for debuggability, maintain economical design without /orchestrate's heaviness (PR automation, dashboard, extensive dry-run) or complex retry mechanisms.

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Command file exists at `.claude/commands/coordinate.md` with 2,500-3,000 lines (not 5,438 like /orchestrate)
- [ ] Zero code-fenced Task invocation examples (prevents 0% delegation rate)
- [ ] All agent invocations use imperative pattern with unwrapped Task blocks
- [ ] Wave-based implementation integrated for Phase 3 using dependency-analyzer.sh
- [ ] Clear verification checkpoints with actionable error messages (for debuggability)
- [ ] Context pruning between phases maintains <30% context usage
- [ ] Checkpoint save/resume for interruption recovery
- [ ] All tests passing with >80% coverage of agent invocation patterns
- [ ] Documentation complete with usage examples and migration guide from /supervise
- [ ] Single high-functioning workflow - no complex retry mechanisms or fallbacks

### Core Components

**1. Workflow Orchestration (from /supervise)**
- 7-phase sequential structure (Phase 0-6)
- Workflow scope detection (research-only, research-and-plan, full-implementation, debug-only)
- Path pre-calculation before agent invocations
- Metadata-based context passing (forward message pattern)

**2. Wave-Based Implementation (from /orchestrate via dependency-analyzer.sh)**
- Phase dependency graph construction
- Topological sorting (Kahn's algorithm)
- Wave identification (phases with no remaining dependencies)
- Parallel execution within waves
- Wave-level progress tracking and checkpointing

**3. Agent Invocation Standards (fixes from Report 489/490)**
- Imperative markers within 5 lines of Task blocks ("EXECUTE NOW", "YOU MUST")
- NO code-fenced YAML examples (unwrapped Task invocations only)
- Direct behavioral file references (`.claude/agents/*.md`)
- Explicit completion signals (e.g., `PLAN_CREATED:`, `REPORT_CREATED:`)
- Behavioral content in agent files, not inline (Standard 12 compliance)

**4. Reliability Through Clarity**
- Clear verification checkpoints: mandatory checks after each file creation
- Fail-fast with detailed error messages: immediate feedback for debugging
- No complex retry mechanisms: single execution path that can be debugged and improved
- Context pruning between phases: 80-90% reduction for completed phases
- Checkpoint save/resume: state preservation for interruption recovery

## Testing Strategy

### Test Categories

**1. Agent Delegation Tests** (Priority: CRITICAL)
- Verify 100% delegation rate (all intended agents invoked)
- Test imperative markers prevent priming effect
- Validate behavioral injection pattern
- Test multi-template retry escalation

**2. Wave Execution Tests** (Priority: HIGH)
- Dependency graph construction accuracy
- Wave calculation correctness (Kahn's algorithm)
- Parallel execution within waves
- Wave-level checkpoint save/restore

**3. Standards Compliance Tests** (Priority: HIGH)
- Zero code-fenced Task examples (prevents 0% delegation)
- Imperative markers within 5 lines of Task blocks
- Behavioral content in agent files (not inline)
- Verification checkpoints after file creation

**4. Workflow Tests** (Priority: MEDIUM)
- Research-only workflow (Phases 0-1)
- Research-and-plan workflow (Phases 0-2)
- Full-implementation workflow (Phases 0-6)
- Debug-only workflow (Phases 0, 1, 5)

**5. Reliability Tests** (Priority: MEDIUM)
- Verification checkpoint accuracy (all expected files detected)
- Clear error message quality (all failures have debugging info)
- Fail-fast behavior (no retries, immediate exit with diagnostics)
- Checkpoint recovery from interruption

**6. Performance Tests** (Priority: LOW)
- Context usage at phase boundaries (<30%)
- Wave-based time savings (40-60%)
- Error message overhead (negligible - fail-fast design)
- File size within budget (2,500-3,000 lines)

### Test Execution

```bash
# Run all coordinate tests
bash .claude/tests/test_coordinate_basic.sh
bash .claude/tests/test_coordinate_delegation.sh
bash .claude/tests/test_coordinate_waves.sh
bash .claude/tests/test_coordinate_standards.sh

# Integration test (run actual workflow)
/coordinate "Research authentication patterns to create plan" --dry-run

# Performance benchmark
time /coordinate "Implement feature X" --parallel
```

### Coverage Requirements

- **Agent Invocation Coverage**: 100% (all 7 agents tested)
- **Wave Execution Coverage**: 100% (all dependency patterns tested)
- **Standards Coverage**: 100% (all 3 violations prevented)
- **Workflow Coverage**: 100% (all 4 workflow types tested)
- **Overall Test Coverage**: ≥80% (20+ tests across all categories)

## Documentation Requirements

## Dependencies

### Library Dependencies (All Must Exist)
- `.claude/lib/workflow-detection.sh` - Workflow scope detection (fallback available)
- `.claude/lib/unified-location-detection.sh` - Topic directory creation (REQUIRED)
- `.claude/lib/dependency-analyzer.sh` - Wave calculation (REQUIRED for Phase 3)
- `.claude/lib/checkpoint-utils.sh` - Save/restore state (REQUIRED)
- `.claude/lib/context-pruning.sh` - Context reduction (REQUIRED)
- `.claude/lib/unified-logger.sh` - Progress markers (REQUIRED)
- `.claude/lib/error-handling.sh` - Retry logic (REQUIRED)

### Agent Dependencies (All Must Exist)
- `.claude/agents/research-specialist.md` - Research agent
- `.claude/agents/plan-architect.md` - Planning agent
- `.claude/agents/implementer-coordinator.md` - Wave orchestration agent
- `.claude/agents/implementation-executor.md` - Single phase executor
- `.claude/agents/test-specialist.md` - Testing agent
- `.claude/agents/debug-analyst.md` - Debug analysis agent
- `.claude/agents/doc-writer.md` - Documentation agent

### External Standards
- Command Architecture Standards (Standard 11, 12) - Must be followed
- Behavioral Injection Pattern - Must be implemented
- Verification-Fallback Pattern - Must be implemented
- Metadata Extraction Pattern - Must be implemented
- Forward Message Pattern - Must be implemented

### Prerequisite Commands
- `/supervise` - Must exist as baseline to copy from
- `/orchestrate` - Must exist as reference for wave-based implementation

## Risk Mitigation

### Risk 1: File Size Budget Exceeded
**Risk**: Adding wave execution + retry logic exceeds 3,000 line target
**Mitigation**:
- Extract retry templates to shared file if needed
- Use library references instead of inline bash where possible
- Monitor size after each phase, adjust if approaching limit

### Risk 2: Wave Execution Complexity
**Risk**: Integrating dependency-analyzer.sh more complex than expected
**Mitigation**:
- Start with simple test plans (2-3 phases, clear dependencies)
- Reference /orchestrate's proven implementation
- Test wave calculation independently before integration

### Risk 3: Agent Delegation Failures
**Risk**: Despite fixes, agents still not invoked correctly
**Mitigation**:
- Implement delegation rate testing from day one
- Use multi-template retry as safety net
- Add diagnostic logging to detect priming effect

### Risk 4: Test Coverage Gaps
**Risk**: Integration tests miss critical failure modes
**Mitigation**:
- Test each phase incrementally during development
- Create failure injection tests (simulate agent errors)
- Validate against known /supervise violations

### Risk 5: Migration Confusion
**Risk**: Users unclear when to use /coordinate vs /supervise
**Mitigation**:
- Create clear migration guide with decision framework
- Document performance benefits quantitatively
- Provide side-by-side comparison examples

## Implementation Notes

### Phase Dependencies
All phases use sequential dependencies ([1], [2], [3], etc.) because this is architectural work where each phase builds on the previous. Wave-based execution is for the command's Phase 3 implementation orchestration, not the plan itself.

### Size Budget Tracking
- Baseline: 2,177 lines (from /supervise)
- Phase 2 reduction: -200 lines (behavioral extraction)
- Phase 3 addition: +200 lines (wave execution)
- Phase 4: -100 lines (remove retry/fallback logic from /supervise, add clear errors: net reduction)
- Phase 5 optimization: -50 lines (pruning references)
- **Estimated Final**: 2,027 lines (well within 2,500-3,000 target, room for additions)

### Key Differences from /orchestrate
**NOT Including** (keeps file economical):
- PR creation automation (too heavy, 200+ lines)
- Dashboard progress tracking (too complex, 150+ lines)
- Extensive dry-run mode (keep simple 50-line version)
- Multiple specialized utility functions (use libraries instead)

**Including from /orchestrate**:
- Wave-based implementation (core feature, 200 lines)
- Checkpoint save/resume (essential, already in /supervise)

### Critical Success Factors
1. Zero code-fenced Task examples (prevents 0% delegation)
2. Wave execution for 40-60% time savings
3. Clear error messages and fail-fast behavior (debuggable, improvable)
4. File size within 2,500-3,000 lines (not 5,438)
5. All standards violations fixed (100% compliance)
6. Single high-functioning workflow - no retry complexity

## Revision History

### 2025-10-27 - Revision 1

**Changes**: Removed multi-template retry strategy and fallback mechanisms in favor of fail-fast error handling with clear diagnostics

**Reason**: User feedback indicated retry mechanisms add needless complexity and unpredictable behavior. A single high-functioning workflow that can be debugged and improved is preferable.

**Specific Modifications**:
1. **Phase 4 Renamed**: "Multi-Template Retry Strategy" → "Clear Error Handling and Diagnostics"
2. **Phase 4 Approach Changed**:
   - Removed: Three-level template escalation (standard → ultra-explicit → step-by-step)
   - Removed: Retry wrapper logic for all agent invocations
   - Removed: Fallback mechanisms (directory creation, file verification retries)
   - Added: Clear verification checkpoints with actionable error messages
   - Added: Fail-fast implementation (NO retries, immediate exit with diagnostics)
   - Added: Comprehensive diagnostic information on every failure
3. **Duration Updated**: Phase 4 reduced from 6-8 hours to 2-3 hours (simpler implementation)
4. **Success Criteria Updated**:
   - Removed: "Multi-template retry strategy implemented (95-98% success rate)"
   - Removed: "Verification-fallback pattern for 100% file creation rate"
   - Added: "Clear verification checkpoints with actionable error messages (for debuggability)"
   - Added: "Single high-functioning workflow - no complex retry mechanisms or fallbacks"
5. **Size Budget Updated**:
   - Original estimate: 2,277 lines (with retry logic)
   - Revised estimate: 2,027 lines (without retry/fallback, net -100 lines from Phase 4)
6. **Testing Updated**: Tests now verify absence of retry logic and fallbacks, presence of clear error messages
7. **Philosophy Shift**: From "defense-in-depth with retries" to "fail-fast with full diagnostics"

**Benefits**:
- Simpler implementation (4-5 hours saved in Phase 4)
- More predictable behavior (single execution path)
- Easier to debug (clear error messages show exactly what failed and why)
- Easier to improve (no complex retry state to manage)
- Smaller codebase (100 fewer lines, more room in budget)

**Reports Used**: None (user-driven revision based on experience with retry/fallback complexity)
