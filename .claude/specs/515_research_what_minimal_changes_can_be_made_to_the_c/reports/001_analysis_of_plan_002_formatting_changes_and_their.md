## Metadata
- **Date**: 2025-10-29
- **Agent**: research-specialist
- **Topic**: Analysis of Plan 002 Formatting Changes and Their Impact
- **Report Type**: Implementation analysis
- **Source Plan**: /home/benjamin/.config/.claude/specs/510_coordinate_error_and_formatting_improvements/plans/002_coordinate_remaining_formatting_improvements.md

## Executive Summary

Plan 002 implemented comprehensive formatting improvements to the /coordinate command across 5 phases (0-4), achieving 50-60% overall context reduction while maintaining functional integrity. The changes focused on eliminating verbose library output, implementing concise verification formats, standardizing progress markers, and simplifying workflow completion summaries. Key achievements include reducing workflow scope detection from 71 lines to 10 lines (86% reduction), making libraries completely silent (30+ lines to 0), and reducing completion summaries from 53 lines to 8 lines (85% reduction). All changes were display-only with no functional modifications, resulting in cleaner user-facing output while preserving verbose diagnostics on failures.

## Findings

### Phase 0: Verification of Implementation Status

**Objective**: Determine actual state of coordinate.md compared to plan 510-001 completion claims

**Priority**: Critical prerequisite
**Complexity**: 1/10 (verification only, no changes)
**Estimated Time**: 30 minutes
**Status**: COMPLETED

**Key Activities** (lines 41-160):
1. Task 0.1: Check coordinate.md current state - searched for verify_file_created() function, checked verification sections, looked for MANDATORY VERIFICATION boxes
2. Task 0.2: Test current coordinate command - ran test workflow to capture actual output and identify formatting issues
3. Task 0.3: Update Plan 510-001 completion status - corrected checkboxes to reflect actual working state

**Findings**:
- verify_file_created() function already exists
- MANDATORY VERIFICATION boxes already removed (contrary to initial analysis)
- Identified library verbose output as root cause of remaining issues
- Verified 4 key issues: F-01 (Bash tool invocations visible), F-02 (verification boxes - actually already fixed), F-03 (71 lines of verbose scope output), F-04 (progress marker inconsistencies)

**Deliverable**: Accurate assessment document showing which phases needed work vs which were already complete

### Phase 1: Library Verbose Output Suppression

**Objective**: Reduce workflow-initialization.sh output from 30+ lines to 0 lines

**Priority**: High (addresses F-01 and F-03)
**Complexity**: 3/10 (simple output suppression)
**Estimated Time**: 1 hour
**Status**: COMPLETED

**Root Cause** (lines 172-194):
- workflow-initialization.sh library producing verbose output not suppressed
- Library echoed 30+ lines during scope detection, path calculation, and directory creation
- Bash tool invocations visible to users (e.g., "Bash(cat > /tmp/...")
- Workflow scope detection produced 71 lines instead of concise summary

**Implementation Philosophy** (lines 207-211):
- Libraries MUST be silent (no output)
- Commands display what users see
- Simpler than verbose/silent modes
- No environment variables needed

**Tasks Completed**:
1. **Task 1.1** (lines 197-215): Remove all echo statements from workflow-initialization.sh (kept only error messages to stderr)
2. **Task 1.2** (lines 217-264): Remove scope detection output - deleted 30+ lines of verbose case statement output
3. **Task 1.3** (lines 266-313): Remove path calculation output - deleted "Pre-calculating artifact paths..." and all path listing output
4. **Task 1.4** (lines 315-359): Remove directory creation output - deleted MANDATORY VERIFICATION box-drawing and creation messages
5. **Task 1.5** (lines 361-402): Remove final output - deleted "Phase 0 Complete" message and artifact path listings
6. **Task 1.6** (lines 404-478): Update coordinate.md to display workflow summary - added clean 8-12 line scope report showing which phases run (✓) vs skip (✗)

**Metrics Achieved** (lines 1618-1622):
- Output reduced: 71 lines → 10 lines (86% reduction)
- Library silent: 30+ lines → 0 lines (100% reduction)
- Bash tool invocations eliminated from user output
- Simple workflow scope report displays phases to execute with ✓/✗ indicators

**File Modified**: `.claude/lib/workflow-initialization.sh` (78 deletions)

### Phase 2: Verification Format Improvements

**Objective**: Implement concise verification format (1-2 lines on success, verbose on failure)

**Priority**: High (addresses F-02)
**Complexity**: 4/10 (requires changes across 6 verification sections)
**Estimated Time**: 3-4 hours
**Status**: COMPLETED (mostly already compliant)

**Standards Compliance** (lines 557-581):
- Implements "Verification with Fail-Fast" pattern from .claude/docs/concepts/patterns/verification-fallback.md
- Philosophy: Fallbacks mask root causes - focus on proper agent invocation with correct paths
- Target: >95% file creation rate through proper agent invocation (not fallbacks)
- Fail-fast with diagnostics when verification fails
- Root cause fix in agent behavioral files, not fallback mechanisms

**Tasks Reviewed**:
1. **Task 2.1** (lines 585-665): Create verify_file_created() helper function - ALREADY EXISTS from plan 510-001
   - Function signature: `verify_file_created(file_path, item_description, phase_name)`
   - Success: prints single "✓" character (no newline)
   - Failure: prints multi-line diagnostic with suggested actions
   - Implements fail-fast: identifies path errors, permission issues, agent failures

2. **Task 2.2** (lines 667-775): Replace Phase 1 research report verification
   - From: 50+ lines with MANDATORY VERIFICATION box-drawing
   - To: Single line "Verifying research reports (N): ✓✓✓ (all passed)"
   - Pattern: `echo -n "Verifying...: "` → call verify_file_created() → `echo " (all passed)"`

3. **Task 2.3** (lines 777-823): Replace Phase 2 plan file verification
   - Pattern: Single line "Verifying implementation plan: ✓ (N phases)"
   - Includes phase count extraction from plan file

4. **Task 2.4** (lines 825-849): Replace Phase 3 implementation verification
   - Pattern: "Verifying implementation artifacts: ✓ (N files)"
   - Counts artifact files in implementation directory

5. **Task 2.5** (lines 851-865): Replace remaining verification sections (Phases 4-6)
   - Applied same concise pattern to test verification, debug verification, summary verification

**Findings from Implementation Summary** (lines 1624-1628):
- Phase 1 verification already concise (from plan 510-001)
- Phase 2 verification already concise (from plan 510-001)
- verify_file_created() helper already implements fail-fast
- **No changes needed** - phase already compliant

**Metrics** (lines 911-920):
- Success output: 50+ lines → 1-2 lines per checkpoint (≥90% reduction)
- Token reduction: ≥3,150 tokens saved
- File creation reliability: >95% through proper agent invocation
- Verification checkpoints present at all file creation points
- Fail-fast occurs when verification fails (no fallback file creation)

### Phase 3: Progress Markers Standardization

**Objective**: Apply consistent emit_progress format throughout all phase transitions

**Priority**: Medium (addresses F-04)
**Complexity**: 1.5/10 (simple find-replace pattern)
**Estimated Time**: 1-2 hours
**Status**: COMPLETED

**Root Cause** (lines 935-947):
- Mix of box-drawing headers and emit_progress calls
- Some phase transitions had markers, others didn't
- Format inconsistent (some used echo, some used emit_progress)

**Target State**: All phase transitions use emit_progress with format: `PROGRESS: [Phase N] - [action description]`

**Tasks Completed**:
1. **Task 3.1** (lines 951-986): Replace box-drawing phase headers
   - Pattern: Remove `echo "════...  [PHASE HEADER TEXT]  ════..."`
   - Replace with: `emit_progress "N" "[concise phase description]"`
   - Applied to all 7 phase headers (Phases 0-6)

2. **Task 3.2** (lines 989-1017): Standardize phase completion messages
   - Pattern: `echo "Phase N Complete: [description]"` → `emit_progress "N" "[concise completion summary]"`
   - Applied to 6 phase completion messages
   - Example: "Phase 1 Complete: Research artifacts verified" → `emit_progress "1" "Research complete: verified $SUCCESSFUL_REPORT_COUNT/$RESEARCH_COMPLEXITY reports"`

3. **Task 3.3** (lines 1020-1044): Remove redundant echo statements
   - Identified echo statements that duplicate emit_progress information
   - Kept emit_progress only, removed redundant echoes
   - Preserved data display echoes (not progress tracking)

**Implementation Summary** (lines 1630-1634):
- Replaced box-drawing headers with emit_progress
- Updated all phase completion messages
- Removed redundant echo statements
- Consistent format throughout

**Metrics** (lines 1091-1095):
- All phase headers use emit_progress
- No box-drawing characters in progress sections
- Format consistent across all 7 phases
- External parsing scripts work correctly
- Token reduction: ~200 tokens (box-drawing overhead removed)

**File Modified**: `.claude/commands/coordinate.md` (55 insertions including scope report + progress markers)

### Phase 4: Workflow Completion Summary Simplification

**Objective**: Reduce workflow completion summary from 53 lines to 5-8 lines

**Priority**: Low (cosmetic improvement, optional)
**Complexity**: 2/10 (simple template change)
**Estimated Time**: 1 hour
**Status**: COMPLETED

**Root Cause** (lines 1110-1120):
- Current summary included 53 lines:
  - Workflow type and phases executed (5 lines)
  - Artifacts created with file sizes (15 lines)
  - Plan overview with metadata (8 lines)
  - Key findings summary (20+ lines)
  - Next steps (5 lines)
- Impact: ~800 tokens, difficult to scan quickly

**Approach** (lines 1122-1123): Two-tier summary
- Tier 1 (always show): Essential info (5-8 lines)
- Tier 2 (collapsible or separate file): Detailed findings

**Tasks Completed**:
1. **Task 4.1** (lines 1128-1185): Create concise summary template
   - From: 53 lines with verbose box-drawing, detailed file listings, verbose metadata
   - To: 8 lines showing workflow type, artifact counts, next steps
   - Format: "Workflow complete: $WORKFLOW_SCOPE" + artifact counts + "Next: /implement $PLAN_PATH"

2. **Task 4.2** (lines 1187-1220): Create optional detailed summary function
   - Added COORDINATE_VERBOSE=true environment variable support
   - Displays detailed summary with file sizes, plan metadata, additional findings
   - Default output remains concise

**Implementation Summary** (lines 1636-1639):
- Concise summary template created (8 lines)
- Optional detailed summary via COORDINATE_VERBOSE=true
- Token reduction: ~700 tokens (90% reduction)

**Metrics** (lines 1260-1264):
- Default summary: 53 → 8 lines (85% reduction)
- Detailed summary available via COORDINATE_VERBOSE=true
- Essential information preserved in concise format
- Token reduction: ~700 tokens (90% reduction)

## Key Behavioral Changes vs Cosmetic Changes

### Behavioral Changes (Functional Impact)

**1. Library Output Architecture** (Phase 1)
- **Change**: Libraries made completely silent; commands now control all user-facing output
- **Behavioral Impact**: Separation of concerns - libraries perform logic, commands handle presentation
- **Why It Matters**: Enables consistent formatting across all orchestration commands that use workflow-initialization.sh
- **Future Implications**: Other commands (/orchestrate, /supervise) can now customize output without library interference

**2. Workflow Scope Display** (Phase 1, Task 1.6)
- **Change**: Added explicit phase execution report showing ✓ (run) vs ✗ (skip) indicators
- **Behavioral Impact**: Users now see upfront which phases will execute before workflow starts
- **Why It Matters**: Transparency - users can confirm correct workflow scope before committing time
- **Future Implications**: Pattern can be adopted by other orchestration commands

**3. Verification Pattern** (Phase 2)
- **Change**: Implemented fail-fast verification with diagnostic output on failures
- **Behavioral Impact**: Workflow terminates immediately on verification failure with actionable diagnostics
- **Why It Matters**: Failures expose root causes (wrong paths, permission issues) instead of being masked by fallbacks
- **Future Implications**: 95%+ success rate achievable through proper configuration; failures become learning opportunities

**4. Optional Verbose Mode** (Phase 4)
- **Change**: Added COORDINATE_VERBOSE=true environment variable for detailed output
- **Behavioral Impact**: Users can access full detail when troubleshooting without cluttering normal workflows
- **Why It Matters**: Serves both quick-scan use cases (default) and deep-dive debugging (verbose)
- **Future Implications**: Pattern can be applied to other commands for tiered output

### Cosmetic Changes (Display-Only)

**1. Progress Marker Standardization** (Phase 3)
- **Change**: Replaced box-drawing headers with emit_progress calls
- **Display Impact**: Consistent "PROGRESS: [Phase N] - [description]" format throughout
- **Why Cosmetic**: No functional logic changed; same checkpoints, just different formatting
- **Token Savings**: ~200 tokens (box-drawing overhead removed)

**2. Verification Format** (Phase 2)
- **Change**: Success output reduced from 50+ lines to 1-2 lines per checkpoint
- **Display Impact**: "Verifying research reports (3): ✓✓✓ (all passed)" instead of box-drawing and detailed file listings
- **Why Mostly Cosmetic**: Verification logic unchanged; same checks occur, just different display
- **Token Savings**: ≥3,150 tokens (90% reduction in verification output)

**3. Completion Summary** (Phase 4)
- **Change**: Summary reduced from 53 lines to 8 lines (with verbose option for full detail)
- **Display Impact**: Scannable summary showing artifact counts and next steps
- **Why Cosmetic**: No functional changes; same information available, just condensed presentation
- **Token Savings**: ~700 tokens (90% reduction in summary output)

### Classification Summary

| Phase | Change Type | Reason |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| Phase 0 | Verification | N/A - read-only assessment phase |
| Phase 1 (Tasks 1.1-1.5) | **Behavioral** | Library silence changes architectural separation of concerns |
| Phase 1 (Task 1.6) | **Behavioral** | New workflow scope report adds transparency |
| Phase 2 (Task 2.1) | **Behavioral** | verify_file_created() implements fail-fast pattern |
| Phase 2 (Tasks 2.2-2.5) | **Cosmetic** | Display format changes only; verification logic unchanged |
| Phase 3 | **Cosmetic** | Progress marker format standardization; no logic changes |
| Phase 4 (Task 4.1) | **Cosmetic** | Summary condensation; same info, different format |
| Phase 4 (Task 4.2) | **Behavioral** | Optional verbose mode adds new capability |

**Key Insight**: ~60% behavioral (architectural improvements), ~40% cosmetic (display optimization). All behavioral changes were intentional improvements to architecture, transparency, and debugging capabilities - not accidental side effects.

## Modified Files and Nature of Changes

### 1. `.claude/lib/workflow-initialization.sh`

**File Path**: /home/benjamin/.config/.claude/lib/workflow-initialization.sh
**Total Changes**: 78 deletions (no additions)
**Nature**: Library silence - removed all informational echo statements

**Sections Modified**:
1. **STEP 1: Scope Detection** (lines ~98-132)
   - Removed: 30+ lines of verbose case statement output describing each workflow scope
   - Kept: Scope validation logic (silent validation with errors to stderr)
   - Impact: Library no longer produces "Detecting workflow scope..." output

2. **STEP 2: Path Pre-Calculation** (lines ~138-206)
   - Removed: "Pre-calculating artifact paths..." header
   - Removed: Project location, specs root, topic number, topic name display
   - Removed: Pre-calculated artifact paths listing (reports, overview, plan, implementation, debug, summary)
   - Kept: All path calculation logic (unchanged)
   - Impact: Library silently calculates paths; coordinate.md displays summary

3. **STEP 3: Directory Structure Creation** (lines ~215-268)
   - Removed: "Creating topic directory structure..." header
   - Removed: MANDATORY VERIFICATION box-drawing for directory creation
   - Removed: "Creating topic root directory at: $topic_path" message
   - Removed: "✅ VERIFIED: Topic root directory exists" confirmation
   - Removed: "Verification checkpoint passed" message
   - Kept: Directory creation logic (mkdir -p)
   - Impact: Silent directory creation with errors to stderr only

4. **Final Output Section** (lines ~299-352)
   - Removed: "Pre-calculated Artifact Paths:" listing (duplicate of earlier section)
   - Removed: "Phase 0 Complete: Ready for Phase 1 (Research)" message
   - Kept: All export statements (unchanged)
   - Impact: Function returns silently; coordinate.md displays phase completion

**Key Principle**: Libraries provide functionality (path calculation, directory creation, validation), not output. Commands control presentation.

### 2. `.claude/commands/coordinate.md`

**File Path**: /home/benjamin/.config/.claude/commands/coordinate.md
**Total Changes**: 55 insertions
**Nature**: Output display + progress marker standardization

**Additions**:

1. **Workflow Scope Report** (Phase 1, Task 1.6 - ~10-15 lines)
   - Location: After initialize_workflow_paths() call (around line 704-708)
   - Content: Simple scope report showing:
     - Workflow scope name
     - Topic path
     - Phases to execute (✓ for run, ✗ for skip)
   - Format: 8-12 lines per workflow type (research-only, research-and-plan, full-implementation, debug-only)
   - Purpose: Replace verbose library output with concise user-facing summary

2. **Progress Marker Updates** (Phase 3 - ~40 insertions)
   - Location: Throughout file (7 phase headers + 6 completion messages)
   - Pattern: Replaced box-drawing headers with emit_progress calls
   - Example changes:
     - `echo "═══ PHASE 1 ═══"` → `emit_progress "1" "Starting research"`
     - `echo "Phase 1 Complete: ..."` → `emit_progress "1" "Research complete: N reports created"`
   - Purpose: Consistent progress tracking format parseable by external tools

3. **Completion Summary Template** (Phase 4, Task 4.1 - ~5 lines)
   - Location: Workflow completion section (~line 1130-1180)
   - Content: Concise 8-line summary template
   - Format: Workflow type, artifact counts, next steps
   - Purpose: Scannable summary replacing 53-line verbose output

**Modifications** (not additions, but updates to existing code):
- Updated emit_progress calls to include more context (phase numbers, artifact counts)
- Removed redundant echo statements that duplicated emit_progress information

**Key Principle**: Commands own user presentation. Library provides data, command decides how to display it.

## User-Facing Improvements

### 1. Reduced Context Window Consumption

**Overall Impact**: 50-60% reduction in /coordinate output token count

**Breakdown by Component**:
- **Workflow scope detection**: 71 lines → 10 lines (86% reduction)
- **Library output**: 30+ lines → 0 lines (100% reduction)
- **Verification output**: 50+ lines per checkpoint → 1-2 lines (≥90% reduction)
- **Progress markers**: Box-drawing overhead eliminated (~200 tokens saved)
- **Completion summary**: 53 lines → 8 lines (85% reduction)

**Total Token Savings**: ~12,000+ tokens per full workflow (estimated)

**Why It Matters**:
- Longer workflows fit in context window (avoid truncation)
- Faster model processing (fewer tokens to parse)
- Easier to scan output (find relevant information quickly)
- Better cost efficiency (fewer tokens = lower API costs)

### 2. Improved Scannability

**Before**: Users had to scroll through 200+ lines of verbose output to find workflow status
**After**: Critical information visible in first screen (10-15 lines)

**Specific Improvements**:
- **Workflow scope report**: See which phases run upfront (✓/✗ indicators)
- **Verification status**: Single line per checkpoint shows success/failure immediately
- **Progress tracking**: Consistent PROGRESS markers easy to grep/filter
- **Summary**: 8 lines show artifacts created and next steps

**User Benefit**: Can quickly answer "What happened?" and "What's next?" without reading full output

### 3. Workflow Scope Transparency

**New Feature** (Phase 1, Task 1.6): Explicit phase execution report at workflow start

**Example Output**:
```
Workflow Scope: research-and-plan
Topic: /path/to/specs/042_auth

Phases to Execute:
  ✓ Phase 0: Initialization
  ✓ Phase 1: Research (parallel agents)
  ✓ Phase 2: Planning
  ✗ Phase 3: Implementation (skipped)
  ✗ Phase 4: Testing (skipped)
  ✗ Phase 5: Debug (skipped)
  ✗ Phase 6: Documentation (skipped)
```

**Why It Matters**:
- Users confirm correct workflow scope before execution starts
- Prevents surprises ("Why didn't it implement the feature?")
- Clear expectations set upfront (3 phases to run, 4 phases skipped)
- Helps users choose appropriate workflow scope for their task

### 4. Better Error Diagnostics

**Verification Failure Output** (Phase 2, verify_file_created function):

**Before**: Generic "File not found" with no context
**After**: Multi-line diagnostic with actionable suggestions:
```
✗ ERROR [Phase 1]: Research report 2/4 verification failed
   Expected: File exists at /path/to/report.md
   Found: File does not exist

DIAGNOSTIC INFORMATION:
  - Expected path: /path/to/report.md
  - Parent directory: /path/to/reports/
  - Parent exists: yes

Suggested actions:
  1. Check if agent completed successfully
  2. Verify path calculation correct
  3. Check parent directory permissions
  4. Review agent output for error messages
```

**Why It Matters**:
- Users can diagnose root cause themselves (no guesswork)
- Prevents cascading failures (fix problem at source)
- Actionable suggestions guide troubleshooting
- Faster resolution (no back-and-forth with support)

### 5. Optional Detailed Output

**New Feature** (Phase 4, Task 4.2): COORDINATE_VERBOSE=true environment variable

**Use Cases**:
- **Default (concise)**: Quick workflows, familiar users, production use
- **Verbose (detailed)**: Debugging, learning, troubleshooting, first-time use

**What Verbose Mode Shows**:
- Individual file sizes for each artifact
- Plan metadata (complexity, estimated time, phase count)
- Detailed findings summary
- Additional diagnostic information

**Why It Matters**:
- Serves both power users (concise) and beginners (verbose)
- No compromise needed (both modes available)
- Users control verbosity based on context

### 6. Consistent Progress Tracking

**New Standard** (Phase 3): All phase transitions use emit_progress format

**Example Progress Markers**:
```
PROGRESS: [Phase 0] - Initializing workflow
PROGRESS: [Phase 1] - Starting research (3 topics)
PROGRESS: [Phase 1] - Research complete: verified 3/3 reports
PROGRESS: [Phase 2] - Creating implementation plan
PROGRESS: [Phase 2] - Plan complete: 5 phases, 3-4h estimated
```

**Why It Matters**:
- External tools can parse progress (grep, awk, monitoring scripts)
- Consistent format across all phases (no special cases)
- Clear phase attribution (know which phase is running)
- Parseable by automation (CI/CD integration possible)

### 7. Cleaner Terminal Output

**Visual Improvements**:
- No Bash tool invocations visible (e.g., "Bash(cat > /tmp/...)")
- No box-drawing character clutter (═══, ─, │, ┌, └)
- Simple Unicode checkmarks (✓/✗) for verification status
- Minimal whitespace (no excessive blank lines)

**Psychological Impact**:
- Professional appearance (polished output)
- Reduced cognitive load (focus on content, not formatting)
- Faster scanning (less visual noise)
- Better screenshots for documentation

## Key Concepts Requiring Documentation

### 1. Library Silence Architecture

**Concept**: Libraries provide functionality without output; commands control presentation

**Why Users Need to Understand**:
- Explains why workflow-initialization.sh doesn't produce output anymore
- Clarifies separation of concerns (logic vs display)
- Informs future command development (follow this pattern)

**Documentation Needs**:
- Architecture guide explaining library vs command responsibilities
- Migration guide for developers updating other orchestration commands
- Troubleshooting section for silent library debugging

**Key Principle**: "Libraries calculate, commands communicate"

### 2. Workflow Scope Detection

**Concept**: Automatic detection of workflow type from user description, with explicit phase execution report

**Why Users Need to Understand**:
- Users need to know how to phrase workflow descriptions for correct scope detection
- Understanding scope helps users predict which phases will run
- Explains what ✓/✗ indicators mean in workflow scope report

**Documentation Needs**:
- Keyword reference for each workflow scope (research-only, research-and-plan, full-implementation, debug-only)
- Examples of workflow descriptions and their detected scopes
- Explanation of phase execution indicators (✓ = will run, ✗ = will skip)

**Key Phrases**:
- "research [topic]" → research-only
- "research... to create plan" → research-and-plan
- "implement [feature]" → full-implementation
- "fix [bug]" → debug-only

### 3. Concise Verification Pattern

**Concept**: Silent success (single ✓ character), verbose failure (multi-line diagnostics)

**Why Users Need to Understand**:
- Explains why verification output is minimal on success
- Clarifies that verbose output on failure is intentional (not a bug)
- Helps users interpret verification status quickly

**Documentation Needs**:
- Pattern explanation with before/after examples
- Success output format reference
- Failure diagnostic interpretation guide

**Key Behavior**: "Success is quiet, failure is loud"

### 4. Fail-Fast Verification Philosophy

**Concept**: No fallback file creation; immediate failure with root cause diagnostics

**Why Users Need to Understand**:
- Explains why workflow terminates on verification failure (not automatic recovery)
- Clarifies that diagnostics help fix root cause (not workaround symptom)
- Sets expectation that 95%+ success rate achievable through proper configuration

**Documentation Needs**:
- Philosophy explanation (why no fallbacks)
- Common root causes and their fixes
- How to achieve 95%+ success rate
- When to escalate issues vs self-fix

**Key Philosophy**: "Fail fast, diagnose accurately, fix at source"

### 5. Progress Markers (emit_progress)

**Concept**: Standardized progress tracking format parseable by external tools

**Why Users Need to Understand**:
- Enables users to build monitoring/automation around /coordinate
- Explains consistent format across all phases
- Clarifies that progress markers don't replace final output

**Documentation Needs**:
- emit_progress format specification
- Examples of external parsing scripts (grep, awk)
- Integration patterns for CI/CD
- Progress marker semantics (phase numbers, descriptions)

**Key Format**: `PROGRESS: [Phase N] - [description]`

### 6. Two-Tier Summary Output

**Concept**: Concise default summary, detailed verbose summary available via environment variable

**Why Users Need to Understand**:
- Explains how to access detailed output when needed
- Clarifies that information isn't lost (just hidden by default)
- Helps users choose appropriate output level for context

**Documentation Needs**:
- Environment variable reference (COORDINATE_VERBOSE=true)
- Comparison of concise vs verbose output
- Use case guidance (when to use each mode)

**Key Usage**: `COORDINATE_VERBOSE=true /coordinate "..."`

### 7. Context Budget Management

**Concept**: Aggressive output reduction to stay within context window limits

**Why Users Need to Understand**:
- Explains motivation for concise output (not arbitrary preference)
- Clarifies trade-offs (brevity vs detail)
- Helps users understand when verbose mode appropriate

**Documentation Needs**:
- Context window explanation (why it matters)
- Token reduction metrics (before/after comparison)
- Guidelines for choosing concise vs verbose output

**Key Metric**: 50-60% overall reduction, target <30% context usage throughout workflow

### Documentation Priority

**Content Should Include**:
- verify_file_created() function signature and usage
- Success output format (single ✓ character)
- Failure diagnostic format and interpretation
- Fail-fast philosophy explanation
- Integration with agent behavioral files
- Common root causes and fixes

**Why It Matters**: Other commands and agents can adopt this pattern for consistency

### 5. Create Migration Guide for Library Silence

**Priority**: Low
**Effort**: 1 hour
**Deliverable**: Migration guide (.claude/docs/guides/library-silence-migration.md)

**Content Should Include**:
- Philosophy of library silence (logic vs display separation)
- Pattern for converting verbose library to silent library
- How commands should display output after library calls
- Error handling (stderr vs stdout)
- Testing silent libraries

**Why It Matters**: Future library development should follow this pattern

### 6. Add Regression Tests for Output Format

**Priority**: High
**Effort**: 3-4 hours
**Deliverable**: Test scripts (.claude/tests/test_coordinate_output.sh)

**Test Coverage**:
1. Workflow scope report format validation (✓/✗ indicators present)
2. Verification output format validation (single line on success)
3. Progress marker consistency (all phases use emit_progress)
4. Completion summary format validation (8-line concise format)
5. Verbose mode activation (COORDINATE_VERBOSE=true)
6. Library silence verification (no stdout from workflow-initialization.sh)

**Why It Matters**: Prevent regression of formatting improvements in future changes

### 7. Measure Real-World Context Usage

**Priority**: Medium
**Effort**: 1 hour
**Deliverable**: Metrics collection script and baseline measurements

**Metrics to Collect**:
- Token counts before/after formatting changes (validation of 50-60% reduction claim)
- Output line counts by workflow type (research-only, research-and-plan, full-implementation)
- Verification output line counts (success vs failure)
- Progress marker counts by phase

**Why It Matters**: Validate improvement claims with real data; identify further optimization opportunities

### Implementation Sequence

**Phase 1** (Immediate - User Impact):
1. Create user-facing documentation guide
2. Add regression tests for output format

**Phase 2** (Short-term - Consistency):
3. Update existing orchestration commands (/orchestrate, /supervise)
4. Document verification pattern for agent developers

**Phase 3** (Long-term - Enablement):
5. Add progress monitoring examples
6. Create migration guide for library silence
7. Measure real-world context usage
