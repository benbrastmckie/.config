## Executive Summary

Plan 002 implemented comprehensive formatting improvements to the /coordinate command across 5 phases (0-4), achieving 50-60% overall context reduction while maintaining functional integrity. The changes focused on eliminating verbose library output, implementing concise verification formats, standardizing progress markers, and simplifying workflow completion summaries. Key achievements include reducing workflow scope detection from 71 lines to 10 lines (86% reduction), making libraries completely silent (30+ lines to 0), and reducing completion summaries from 53 lines to 8 lines (85% reduction). All changes were display-only with no functional modifications, resulting in cleaner user-facing output while preserving verbose diagnostics on failures.

## Findings

### Phase 0: Verification of Implementation Status

**Objective**: Determine actual state of coordinate.md compared to plan 510-001 completion claims

**Priority**: Critical prerequisite
**Complexity**: 1/10 (verification only, no changes)
**Estimated Time**: 30 minutes
**Status**: COMPLETED

**Key Activities** (lines 41-160):
1. Task 0.1: Check coordinate.md current state - searched for verify_file_created() function, checked verification sections, looked for MANDATORY VERIFICATION boxes
2. Task 0.2: Test current coordinate command - ran test workflow to capture actual output and identify formatting issues
3. Task 0.3: Update Plan 510-001 completion status - corrected checkboxes to reflect actual working state

**Findings**:
- verify_file_created() function already exists
- MANDATORY VERIFICATION boxes already removed (contrary to initial analysis)
- Identified library verbose output as root cause of remaining issues
- Verified 4 key issues: F-01 (Bash tool invocations visible), F-02 (verification boxes - actually already fixed), F-03 (71 lines of verbose scope output), F-04 (progress marker inconsistencies)

**Deliverable**: Accurate assessment document showing which phases needed work vs which were already complete

### Phase 1: Library Verbose Output Suppression

**Objective**: Reduce workflow-initialization.sh output from 30+ lines to 0 lines

**Priority**: High (addresses F-01 and F-03)
**Complexity**: 3/10 (simple output suppression)
**Estimated Time**: 1 hour
**Status**: COMPLETED

**Root Cause** (lines 172-194):
- workflow-initialization.sh library producing verbose output not suppressed
- Library echoed 30+ lines during scope detection, path calculation, and directory creation
- Bash tool invocations visible to users (e.g., "Bash(cat > /tmp/...")
- Workflow scope detection produced 71 lines instead of concise summary

**Implementation Philosophy** (lines 207-211):
- Libraries MUST be silent (no output)
- Commands display what users see
- Simpler than verbose/silent modes
- No environment variables needed

**Tasks Completed**:
1. **Task 1.1** (lines 197-215): Remove all echo statements from workflow-initialization.sh (kept only error messages to stderr)
2. **Task 1.2** (lines 217-264): Remove scope detection output - deleted 30+ lines of verbose case statement output
3. **Task 1.3** (lines 266-313): Remove path calculation output - deleted "Pre-calculating artifact paths..." and all path listing output
4. **Task 1.4** (lines 315-359): Remove directory creation output - deleted MANDATORY VERIFICATION box-drawing and creation messages
5. **Task 1.5** (lines 361-402): Remove final output - deleted "Phase 0 Complete" message and artifact path listings
6. **Task 1.6** (lines 404-478): Update coordinate.md to display workflow summary - added clean 8-12 line scope report showing which phases run (✓) vs skip (✗)

**Metrics Achieved** (lines 1618-1622):
- Output reduced: 71 lines → 10 lines (86% reduction)
- Library silent: 30+ lines → 0 lines (100% reduction)
- Bash tool invocations eliminated from user output
- Simple workflow scope report displays phases to execute with ✓/✗ indicators

**File Modified**: `.claude/lib/workflow-initialization.sh` (78 deletions)

### Phase 2: Verification Format Improvements

**Objective**: Implement concise verification format (1-2 lines on success, verbose on failure)

**Priority**: High (addresses F-02)
**Complexity**: 4/10 (requires changes across 6 verification sections)
**Estimated Time**: 3-4 hours
**Status**: COMPLETED (mostly already compliant)

**Standards Compliance** (lines 557-581):
- Implements "Verification with Fail-Fast" pattern from .claude/docs/concepts/patterns/verification-fallback.md
- Philosophy: Fallbacks mask root causes - focus on proper agent invocation with correct paths
- Target: >95% file creation rate through proper agent invocation (not fallbacks)
- Fail-fast with diagnostics when verification fails
- Root cause fix in agent behavioral files, not fallback mechanisms

**Tasks Reviewed**:
1. **Task 2.1** (lines 585-665): Create verify_file_created() helper function - ALREADY EXISTS from plan 510-001
   - Function signature: `verify_file_created(file_path, item_description, phase_name)`
   - Success: prints single "✓" character (no newline)
   - Failure: prints multi-line diagnostic with suggested actions
   - Implements fail-fast: identifies path errors, permission issues, agent failures

2. **Task 2.2** (lines 667-775): Replace Phase 1 research report verification
   - From: 50+ lines with MANDATORY VERIFICATION box-drawing
   - To: Single line "Verifying research reports (N): ✓✓✓ (all passed)"
   - Pattern: `echo -n "Verifying...: "` → call verify_file_created() → `echo " (all passed)"`

3. **Task 2.3** (lines 777-823): Replace Phase 2 plan file verification
   - Pattern: Single line "Verifying implementation plan: ✓ (N phases)"
   - Includes phase count extraction from plan file

4. **Task 2.4** (lines 825-849): Replace Phase 3 implementation verification
   - Pattern: "Verifying implementation artifacts: ✓ (N files)"
   - Counts artifact files in implementation directory

5. **Task 2.5** (lines 851-865): Replace remaining verification sections (Phases 4-6)
   - Applied same concise pattern to test verification, debug verification, summary verification

**Findings from Implementation Summary** (lines 1624-1628):
- Phase 1 verification already concise (from plan 510-001)
- Phase 2 verification already concise (from plan 510-001)
- verify_file_created() helper already implements fail-fast
- **No changes needed** - phase already compliant

**Metrics** (lines 911-920):
- Success output: 50+ lines → 1-2 lines per checkpoint (≥90% reduction)
- Token reduction: ≥3,150 tokens saved
- File creation reliability: >95% through proper agent invocation
- Verification checkpoints present at all file creation points
- Fail-fast occurs when verification fails (no fallback file creation)

### Phase 3: Progress Markers Standardization

**Objective**: Apply consistent emit_progress format throughout all phase transitions

**Priority**: Medium (addresses F-04)
**Complexity**: 1.5/10 (simple find-replace pattern)
**Estimated Time**: 1-2 hours
**Status**: COMPLETED

**Root Cause** (lines 935-947):
- Mix of box-drawing headers and emit_progress calls
- Some phase transitions had markers, others didn't
- Format inconsistent (some used echo, some used emit_progress)

**Target State**: All phase transitions use emit_progress with format: `PROGRESS: [Phase N] - [action description]`

**Tasks Completed**:
1. **Task 3.1** (lines 951-986): Replace box-drawing phase headers
   - Pattern: Remove `echo "════...  [PHASE HEADER TEXT]  ════..."`
   - Replace with: `emit_progress "N" "[concise phase description]"`
   - Applied to all 7 phase headers (Phases 0-6)

2. **Task 3.2** (lines 989-1017): Standardize phase completion messages
   - Pattern: `echo "Phase N Complete: [description]"` → `emit_progress "N" "[concise completion summary]"`
   - Applied to 6 phase completion messages
   - Example: "Phase 1 Complete: Research artifacts verified" → `emit_progress "1" "Research complete: verified $SUCCESSFUL_REPORT_COUNT/$RESEARCH_COMPLEXITY reports"`

3. **Task 3.3** (lines 1020-1044): Remove redundant echo statements
   - Identified echo statements that duplicate emit_progress information
   - Kept emit_progress only, removed redundant echoes
   - Preserved data display echoes (not progress tracking)

**Implementation Summary** (lines 1630-1634):
- Replaced box-drawing headers with emit_progress
- Updated all phase completion messages
- Removed redundant echo statements
- Consistent format throughout

**Metrics** (lines 1091-1095):
- All phase headers use emit_progress
- No box-drawing characters in progress sections
- Format consistent across all 7 phases
- External parsing scripts work correctly
- Token reduction: ~200 tokens (box-drawing overhead removed)

**File Modified**: `.claude/commands/coordinate.md` (55 insertions including scope report + progress markers)

### Phase 4: Workflow Completion Summary Simplification

**Objective**: Reduce workflow completion summary from 53 lines to 5-8 lines

**Priority**: Low (cosmetic improvement, optional)
**Complexity**: 2/10 (simple template change)
**Estimated Time**: 1 hour
**Status**: COMPLETED

**Root Cause** (lines 1110-1120):
- Current summary included 53 lines:
  - Workflow type and phases executed (5 lines)
  - Artifacts created with file sizes (15 lines)
  - Plan overview with metadata (8 lines)
  - Key findings summary (20+ lines)
  - Next steps (5 lines)
- Impact: ~800 tokens, difficult to scan quickly

**Approach** (lines 1122-1123): Two-tier summary
- Tier 1 (always show): Essential info (5-8 lines)
- Tier 2 (collapsible or separate file): Detailed findings

**Tasks Completed**:
1. **Task 4.1** (lines 1128-1185): Create concise summary template
   - From: 53 lines with verbose box-drawing, detailed file listings, verbose metadata
   - To: 8 lines showing workflow type, artifact counts, next steps
   - Format: "Workflow complete: $WORKFLOW_SCOPE" + artifact counts + "Next: /implement $PLAN_PATH"

2. **Task 4.2** (lines 1187-1220): Create optional detailed summary function
   - Added COORDINATE_VERBOSE=true environment variable support
   - Displays detailed summary with file sizes, plan metadata, additional findings
   - Default output remains concise

**Implementation Summary** (lines 1636-1639):
- Concise summary template created (8 lines)
- Optional detailed summary via COORDINATE_VERBOSE=true
- Token reduction: ~700 tokens (90% reduction)

**Metrics** (lines 1260-1264):
- Default summary: 53 → 8 lines (85% reduction)
- Detailed summary available via COORDINATE_VERBOSE=true
- Essential information preserved in concise format
- Token reduction: ~700 tokens (90% reduction)
