# Function Placement Research: Overview and Synthesis

## Research Topic
Should the `display_brief_summary()` function be defined elsewhere (outside supervise.md)? Review .claude/docs/ to identify and follow standards. Look for other functions that should be defined elsewhere to keep supervise.md efficient.

## Research Status
✅ Complete - All 4 subtopic reports analyzed and synthesized

## Executive Summary

**Answer: NO - Keep `display_brief_summary()` inline in /supervise command file.**

The comprehensive analysis of command architecture standards, supervise.md organization, library extraction patterns, and command-wide standardization reveals that `display_brief_summary()` is **correctly placed as an inline function**. This placement follows established patterns and serves workflow-specific needs that cannot be generalized.

### Key Findings

1. **Standards Gap Identified**: Command architecture standards define structural templates (must be inline) vs behavioral content (must be referenced), but **provide no explicit guidance** for small utility functions (10-50 lines)

2. **Exemplary Architecture**: supervise.md demonstrates **library-first design** with only 1 inline function out of 2,177 lines (0.05% inline ratio) - representing best-practice separation of concerns

3. **No Extraction Opportunity**: Analysis of 59 libraries and 30+ commands reveals that library functions provide **domain-specific utilities** (parsing, validation, formatting), while command-specific functions provide **workflow-specific presentation**

4. **Non-Standard Pattern**: Only 1 out of 14 workflow commands (7%) uses a dedicated display function; the remaining 93% use checkpoint-based completion reporting

## Answer to Main Question

### Should `display_brief_summary` be moved?

**NO** - The function should remain inline in supervise.md for the following reasons:

1. **Single-Command Usage**: Only used by /supervise workflow (no reuse across other commands)

2. **Workflow-Specific Logic**: Tightly coupled to /supervise's unique multi-scope architecture (research-only, research-and-plan, full-implementation, debug-only)

3. **High Context Coupling**: References 7 workflow-specific variables (`$WORKFLOW_SCOPE`, `$TOPIC_PATH`, `$REPORT_PATHS[@]`, `$PLAN_PATH`, `$SUMMARY_PATH`, `$DEBUG_REPORT`)

4. **Appropriate Complexity**: 30 lines of simple case/echo statements - below 50-line threshold for library extraction

5. **Library Pattern Violation**: Extracting would create a "workflow-specific library function" - violating the established domain-specific library organization pattern

6. **Maintenance Burden**: Moving to library would require passing 7+ parameters, increasing complexity vs current inline approach

## Cross-Cutting Themes

### Theme 1: Clear Separation of Domain-Specific vs Workflow-Specific Functions

**Pattern Across All Reports**:

- **Domain-Specific Functions** → Extract to libraries (error-handling.sh, metadata-extraction.sh, etc.)
  - Reusable across 2+ commands
  - Stateless/pure operations
  - Complex implementation benefiting from centralization
  - Example: `format_error_report()` used by 5+ commands

- **Workflow-Specific Functions** → Keep inline in commands
  - Single-command usage
  - Context-dependent (references command variables)
  - Simple implementation (<50 lines)
  - Example: `display_brief_summary()` in /supervise only

### Theme 2: Library-First Architecture as Best Practice

**Evidence**:

- supervise.md: 99.95% of functions externalized to 7 libraries
- Only 1 inline function in 2,177 lines
- Strategic function placement: libraries sourced first → inline definition → verification → command logic
- All 59 existing libraries follow domain-specific organization (NO workflow-specific libraries exist)

**Implication**: The current architecture represents **deliberate design** following the 2025-10-14 "clean-break refactor" that extracted 300-400 LOC to modular libraries.

### Theme 3: Standards Gap for Utility Function Placement

**Discovery**: Command Architecture Standards comprehensively define:
- ✅ Structural templates (Task blocks, JSON schemas) → INLINE
- ✅ Behavioral content (agent STEP sequences) → REFERENCE agent files
- ❌ **Small utility functions (10-50 lines)** → NO EXPLICIT GUIDANCE

**Pattern Applied by Analogy**:
- Multi-command usage → Extract to library (apply "Single Source of Truth" principle)
- Single-command usage + workflow-specific variables → Keep inline (apply "Workflow-Specific Context Injection" pattern)

### Theme 4: Non-Standard Pattern with Valid Use Case

**Checkpoint Pattern** (93% adoption):
- Structured `CHECKPOINT:` blocks with key-value pairs
- Used for completion reporting + error recovery
- Inline in command markdown (not extracted to functions)

**Display Function Pattern** (7% adoption):
- Only /supervise uses `display_brief_summary()` function
- Serves 4 workflow scopes with different completion messages
- Prevents duplication across 4 invocation points

**Why Different?**:
- Other commands: Single workflow type → inline echo statements sufficient
- /supervise: 4 workflow types × 4 invocation points = 30-line case statement extracted to function for DRY principle

## Synthesized Recommendations

### Priority 1: Keep Current Architecture (HIGH - Immediate Action)

**Action**: NO CHANGES to `display_brief_summary()` placement

**Rationale**: Function is correctly placed as inline, workflow-specific utility. All 4 subtopic reports converge on this conclusion.

**Implementation**: Add explanatory comment per Report 001 recommendation:

```bash
# Define display_brief_summary inline
# (Command-specific: Uses $WORKFLOW_SCOPE from /supervise workflow detection.
#  Other commands use checkpoint-based completion. Not extracted to library.)
display_brief_summary() {
  # ... existing implementation
}
```

### Priority 2: Document Utility Function Placement Standards (MEDIUM)

**Action**: Add Standard 13 to Command Architecture Standards (`.claude/docs/reference/command_architecture_standards.md`)

**Content** (from Report 001):

```markdown
### Standard 13: Utility Function Placement

**Command-Specific Utility Functions** (INLINE):
- Single-use functions specific to one command's workflow
- Functions using command-specific variables/state
- Functions <50 lines that aid command readability
- Functions called only within one command file

**Reusable Utility Functions** (EXTRACT TO LIBRARY):
- Deterministic operations used by 2+ commands
- Functions providing standardized operations (location detection, parsing)
- Functions enhancing performance (caching, optimization)
- Functions managing shared state (checkpoints, logs)

**Decision Criterion**: Apply "If I change this, where do I update it?" test
- "Only in this command" → INLINE
- "In multiple commands" → EXTRACT to library
```

### Priority 3: Document Completion Pattern Standards (MEDIUM)

**Action**: Add completion pattern guidance to Command Architecture Standards (from Report 004):

```markdown
## Standard 12: Completion Output Patterns

### Checkpoint-Based Completion (Recommended)
USE structured checkpoint blocks for completion reporting in workflow commands.

### Inline Display Functions (Special Cases)
USE inline display functions when:
- Multiple workflow scopes require different completion messages
- Function is called from 3+ locations in same command
- Workflow-specific guidance varies significantly

AVOID extracting to libraries unless used by 3+ commands.
```

### Priority 4: Add Library Extraction Criteria Documentation (LOW)

**Action**: Create `.claude/docs/guides/library-design-guide.md` or extend `.claude/lib/README.md` (from Report 003)

**Content**: Document the 5-criteria test for library extraction:
1. **Reusable**: Used by 2+ commands
2. **Domain-Specific**: Focused on one problem domain (not workflow-specific)
3. **Complex**: Non-trivial logic (>20 lines or complex algorithm)
4. **Stateless**: Minimal dependencies on command execution context
5. **Testable**: Can be unit tested independently

### Priority 5: Consider File Verification Pattern Extraction (LOW)

**Action**: Evaluate extracting common verification pattern to `validation-utils.sh` (from Report 003)

**Observed Pattern** (appears in 10+ commands):
```bash
if ! retry_with_backoff 2 1000 test -f "$FILE_PATH" -a -s "$FILE_PATH"; then
  echo "❌ ERROR: File not created"
  exit 1
fi
echo "✓ VERIFIED: File created"
```

**Proposed Library Function**:
```bash
verify_file_creation() {
  local file_path="${1:-}"
  local description="${2:-File}"

  if ! retry_with_backoff 2 1000 test -f "$file_path" -a -s "$file_path"; then
    echo "❌ ERROR: $description not created at $file_path"
    return 1
  fi

  echo "✓ VERIFIED: $description created at $file_path"
  return 0
}
```

**Benefit**: Meets all library extraction criteria (reusable, domain-specific, testable)

## Other Functions That Should Be Defined Elsewhere

Based on analysis of supervise.md and library patterns:

### Functions Already Correctly Externalized (13+ functions)

All other functions in supervise.md are **already in libraries**:

1. `detect_workflow_scope()` - workflow-detection.sh
2. `should_run_phase()` - workflow-detection.sh
3. `classify_error()` - error-handling.sh
4. `suggest_recovery()` - error-handling.sh
5. `retry_with_backoff()` - error-handling.sh
6. `save_checkpoint()` - checkpoint-utils.sh
7. `restore_checkpoint()` - checkpoint-utils.sh
8. `emit_progress()` - unified-logger.sh
9. Plus 5+ additional library functions from unified-location-detection.sh, metadata-extraction.sh, context-pruning.sh

### No Inline Functions Requiring Extraction

**Finding**: supervise.md has only 1 inline function (`display_brief_summary`), which is correctly placed.

**Broader Analysis**: Review of 30+ commands found no systematic inline function duplication requiring library extraction. The 2025-10-14 refactor successfully externalized all reusable logic.

## Related Work and Future Considerations

### Potential Enhancement: Validation Script

**From Report 001**: Extend `.claude/tests/validate_command_structure.sh` to check:

1. Inline functions have explanatory comments
2. Inline functions are <50 lines
3. No duplicate function definitions across commands

### Potential Enhancement: Decision Tree Quick Reference

**From Report 001**: Create `.claude/docs/quick-reference/function-placement-decision-tree.md` with flowchart for "Should this function be inline or in a library?"

### Potential Enhancement: Document supervise.md as Architecture Exemplar

**From Report 002**: Use supervise.md as reference template for other commands:
- Library-first design (99.95% externalization)
- Strategic function ordering (sourcing → inline → verification → logic)
- Comprehensive error handling for library loading
- Explicit documentation of design decisions

## Conclusion

The `display_brief_summary()` function in /supervise command file represents **correct application of function placement principles** despite the absence of explicit standards for this category of utility functions. The function is:

- **Workflow-specific** (unique to /supervise's multi-scope architecture)
- **Appropriately sized** (30 lines, below 50-line threshold)
- **Correctly placed** (inline after library sourcing, before verification)
- **Well-documented** (explicit note that it's intentionally inline)
- **Non-reusable** (other commands use different completion patterns)

**No extraction to library is warranted.** The recommended action is to enhance documentation (add explanatory comment) and formalize utility function placement standards to guide future development.
