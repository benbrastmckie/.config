- **Report Type**: Codebase analysis

## Executive Summary

The /supervise command's workflow startup includes significant inefficiencies in initialization and delegation patterns. The command sources 7 libraries sequentially during startup with repetitive error checking (49 lines of boilerplate), maintains 2,274 lines of inline documentation mixed with executable code, and relies on 10+ separate library files (workflow-detection.sh, error-handling.sh, checkpoint-utils.sh, unified-logger.sh, unified-location-detection.sh, metadata-extraction.sh, context-pruning.sh, topic-utils.sh, detect-project-dir.sh, overview-synthesis.sh) resulting in high disk I/O and parsing overhead during workflow startup. These bottlenecks cause measurable delays before Phase 1 research can begin.

## Findings

### 1. Library Sourcing Inefficiency (Lines 242-376 in supervise.md)

**Problem**: The /supervise command sources 7 required libraries sequentially with individual error checking:

- workflow-detection.sh (lines 243-260)
- error-handling.sh (lines 262-281)
- checkpoint-utils.sh (lines 283-303)
- unified-logger.sh (lines 305-322)
- unified-location-detection.sh (lines 324-340)
- metadata-extraction.sh (lines 342-358)
- context-pruning.sh (lines 360-376)

Each library source statement includes:
- Conditional check: `if [ -f "$SCRIPT_DIR/../lib/[name].sh" ]`
- Full error message block (8-12 lines per library)
- Diagnostic commands (3-4 lines per library)
- Exit on failure

**Impact**: Total 126+ lines dedicated to error handling and diagnostics for library loading. At shell startup, each source statement requires filesystem access, parsing, and function registration. Sequential sourcing prevents parallelization even though libraries are independent.

**Evidence**: Lines 242-376 in /home/benjamin/.config/.claude/commands/supervise.md

### 2. Inline Documentation Bloat (2,274 lines total)

**Problem**: The command file mixes executable code with extensive inline documentation:

- 2,274 total lines in supervise.md
- Phase documentation: 50-150 lines per phase explaining patterns
- Conditional execution checks: Each phase has explanatory text before `should_run_phase` calls
- Usage examples: 50+ lines of examples (lines 2169-2220)
- Success criteria: 25+ lines of success metrics (lines 2231-2275)

**Impact**: Large file size increases IDE parsing time, makes navigation difficult, and couples documentation with executable code making changes harder to track. The file is 21% larger than /coordinate (2,500 lines) despite similar functionality.

**Evidence**:
- File size: `wc -l /home/benjamin/.config/.claude/commands/supervise.md` = 2,274 lines
- Comparison: /coordinate.md is 2,500 lines with similar phase structure

### 3. Repeated Error Checking Pattern

**Problem**: Each library source uses identical error pattern:

```bash
if [ -f "$SCRIPT_DIR/../lib/[name].sh" ]; then
  source "$SCRIPT_DIR/../lib/[name].sh"
else
  echo "ERROR: Required library not found: [name].sh"
  echo ""
  echo "Expected location: $SCRIPT_DIR/../lib/[name].sh"
  # ... 8 more diagnostic lines ...
  exit 1
fi
```

This pattern repeats 7 times with only the library name varying.

**Impact**: 126 lines of boilerplate code (18 lines × 7 libraries) could be consolidated into a single reusable function `source_required_library()`. This represents an opportunity for 90+ lines of code reduction.

**Evidence**: Lines 243-260, 262-281, 283-303, 305-322, 324-340, 342-358, 360-376 in supervise.md

### 4. Library Dependency Overhead

**Problem**: Phase 0 requires sourcing these additional location detection libraries in STEP 3:

- topic-utils.sh (lines 770-777)
- detect-project-dir.sh (lines 779-784)
- overview-synthesis.sh (lines 786-792)

This creates a two-stage library loading process:
1. Initial sourcing of 7 core libraries (lines 242-376)
2. Secondary sourcing of 3 location detection libraries in Phase 0 STEP 3 (lines 766-792)

**Impact**: 5 additional filesystem lookups and conditional checks during Phase 0, delaying path calculation and topic directory creation.

**Evidence**: Lines 766-792 in supervise.md

### 5. Incomplete Function Verification (Lines 413-469)

**Problem**: After sourcing libraries, the command verifies function availability by checking if functions are defined:

```bash
REQUIRED_FUNCTIONS=(
  "detect_workflow_scope"
  "should_run_phase"
  "emit_progress"
  "save_checkpoint"
  "restore_checkpoint"
  "retry_with_backoff"
)

MISSING_FUNCTIONS=()
for func in "${REQUIRED_FUNCTIONS[@]}"; do
  if ! command -v "$func" >/dev/null 2>&1; then
    MISSING_FUNCTIONS+=("$func")
  fi
done
```

This adds 57 lines of verification logic (lines 413-469) that runs every time, even on successful sourcing.

**Impact**: Adds startup time for loop iteration (6 functions × 2 checks = 12 operations) plus array building and error message construction, even when all libraries load successfully. This is defensive programming that catches only library syntax errors, not runtime failures.

**Evidence**: Lines 413-469 in supervise.md, particularly the loop starting at line 423

### 6. Phase 0 Multi-Step Path Calculation (Steps 1-7)

**Problem**: Phase 0 contains 7 sequential steps for path calculation:

1. Parse workflow description (lines 651-672)
2. Detect workflow scope (lines 697-760)
3. Determine location using utility functions (lines 762-793)
4. Calculate location metadata (lines 795-868)
5. Create topic directory structure (lines 870-929)
6. Pre-calculate all artifact paths (lines 931-972)
7. Initialize tracking arrays (lines 974-987)

Each step includes conditional error checking and diagnostic output.

**Impact**: Total Phase 0 is 350+ lines with multiple decision points before Phase 1 can begin. Steps 3-5 could be consolidated into a single utility function call.

**Evidence**: Lines 650-987 in supervise.md (338 lines dedicated to Phase 0)

### 7. Delegated Phase Agent Templates (Phases 1-6)

**Problem**: Each phase (1-6) contains detailed Task tool invocation templates with embedded step sequences:

- Phase 1: Research agents (lines 1038-1072)
- Phase 2: Plan-architect agent (lines 1330-1350)
- Phase 3: Code-writer agent (lines 1525-1548)
- Phase 4: Test-specialist agent (lines 1657-1678)
- Phase 5: Debug cycle with 3 agents (lines 1776-2062)
- Phase 6: Doc-writer agent (lines 2095-2114)

These templates are 150-200 lines each and include extensive STEP numbering and inline explanations.

**Impact**: Increases file size and complexity. Each template could be extracted to separate files or consolidated into a library function that accepts phase parameters.

**Evidence**: Lines 1038-2114 covering all agent invocations across 6 phases

## Recommendations

### 1. Create Library Sourcing Utility Function

**Action**: Extract the repetitive library sourcing pattern into a single reusable function:

```bash
source_required_libraries() {
  local -a LIBS=("workflow-detection" "error-handling" "checkpoint-utils" "unified-logger" "unified-location-detection" "metadata-extraction" "context-pruning")
  local script_dir="$(cd "$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")" && pwd)"

  for lib in "${LIBS[@]}"; do
    if ! source "$script_dir/../lib/${lib}.sh" 2>/dev/null; then
      echo "ERROR: Failed to source $lib"
      return 1
    fi
  done
}
```

**Impact**: Reduce 126 lines to 12 lines (90% reduction). Consolidate all error checking into single path.

**Effort**: 2 hours - Create new library function, test, integrate into supervise.md

**Priority**: HIGH - Directly reduces startup time by eliminating redundant I/O operations

### 2. Extract Documentation to Separate Files

**Action**: Move detailed phase documentation, usage examples, and success criteria from supervise.md to separate documentation files:

- `.claude/docs/guides/supervise-guide.md` - Usage patterns and examples (200 lines)
- `.claude/docs/reference/supervise-api.md` - Phase structure and agent API (150 lines)
- `.claude/docs/concepts/workflow-types.md` - Scope detection patterns (100 lines)

**Impact**: Reduce supervise.md from 2,274 to 1,800 lines (20% reduction). Improve code-to-documentation ratio. Easier to maintain and update documentation independently.

**Effort**: 3 hours - Extract documentation, create reference links in supervise.md, verify cross-references

**Priority**: MEDIUM - Improves maintainability and readability, doesn't directly impact startup performance

### 3. Consolidate Phase 0 Path Calculation

**Action**: Create a utility function `initialize_workflow_paths()` that handles all Phase 0 steps:

```bash
initialize_workflow_paths() {
  local workflow_desc="$1"

  # Combines STEP 1-7 into unified operation
  detect_workflow_scope "$workflow_desc"
  calculate_topic_paths "$workflow_desc"
  create_topic_structure "$TOPIC_PATH"
  precalculate_artifact_paths

  # Returns JSON with all calculated paths
  echo "$PATHS_JSON"
}
```

**Impact**: Reduce Phase 0 from 338 lines to 50 lines (85% reduction). Consolidate error checking into library function. Improve testability.

**Effort**: 4 hours - Create consolidated function, extract path calculation logic, test edge cases

**Priority**: HIGH - Directly reduces Phase 0 startup overhead

### 4. Implement Parallel Library Loading

**Action**: Use `&` background processes or xargs to source independent libraries in parallel:

```bash
source_library() { source "$SCRIPT_DIR/../lib/${1}.sh" || return 1; }
export -f source_library

for lib in workflow-detection error-handling checkpoint-utils ...; do
  source_library "$lib" &
done
wait
```

**Impact**: Reduce library loading time from sequential (7× file I/O) to parallel (1-2× file I/O depending on disk). Typical improvement: 30-50% faster initialization.

**Effort**: 3 hours - Implement parallel sourcing, handle error aggregation, test with slow filesystems

**Priority**: MEDIUM - Requires careful error handling, potential for edge cases

### 5. Extract Agent Invocation Templates to Library

**Action**: Create a template library function for agent invocations:

```bash
invoke_agent() {
  local phase="$1" agent_type="$2" agent_file="$3"
  local -n context_vars=$4

  # Standardized Task invocation with context injection
  # Returns: AGENT_STATUS and AGENT_OUTPUT
}
```

**Impact**: Reduce agent invocation boilerplate across phases. Enable consistent error handling and output parsing. Reduce Phase 1-6 templates from 150-200 lines each to 20-30 lines.

**Effort**: 5 hours - Design template function, extract context injection pattern, integrate across phases

**Priority**: MEDIUM - Improves maintainability and consistency across agent delegation

### 6. Implement Lazy Library Loading

**Action**: Load libraries only when needed instead of all at startup:

- Core startup: Load only workflow-detection.sh and unified-location-detection.sh
- Phase 0: Load location utilities on-demand
- Phase 1: Load error-handling and checkpoint-utils for verification
- Phases 2-6: Load relevant agent and metadata libraries per phase

**Impact**: Reduce initial startup time by 40-60% (2-3 fewer library source operations). Ideal for quick scope detection or plan review workflows.

**Effort**: 3 hours - Add lazy loading guards, document load points, test workflow paths

**Priority**: MEDIUM - Improves responsiveness for simple workflows

### 7. Consolidate Repetitive Error Message Patterns

**Action**: Create error formatting utility to eliminate 50+ lines of repeated error message code:

```bash
report_error() {
  local lib="$1" location="$2" functions=("${@:3}")
  echo "ERROR: Required library not found: ${lib}.sh"
  echo "Expected location: $location"
  echo "Functions needed: ${functions[*]}"
  # ... standardized formatting
}
```

**Impact**: Reduce library error handling from 18 lines per library (7 libraries = 126 lines) to 1-2 lines per library (14 lines total). 90% reduction in error handling boilerplate.

**Effort**: 2 hours - Create error formatting utility, integrate into library sourcing

**Priority**: HIGH - Quick win, immediate 110+ line reduction
