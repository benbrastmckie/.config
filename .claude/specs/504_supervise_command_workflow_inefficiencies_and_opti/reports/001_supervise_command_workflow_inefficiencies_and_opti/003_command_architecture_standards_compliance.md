# Command Architecture Standards Compliance Research

## Metadata
- **Date**: 2025-10-27
- **Agent**: research-specialist
- **Topic**: Command Architecture Standards Compliance
- **Report Type**: codebase analysis
- **Focus**: /supervise command compliance with established architecture standards

## Executive Summary

The /supervise command demonstrates strong compliance with Command Architecture Standards (established in .claude/docs/reference/command_architecture_standards.md). Key analysis reveals: (1) correct imperative execution patterns with 17 "EXECUTE NOW" directives, (2) proper behavioral injection pattern usage avoiding command chaining, (3) explicit enforcement language (40+ CRITICAL/MANDATORY occurrences), and (4) comprehensive verification and fallback mechanisms. All six core standards (Execution Enforcement, Role Clarification, Imperative Agent Invocation, Structural/Behavioral Separation, File Organization, and Anti-Pattern Avoidance) are successfully implemented.

## Findings

### Current Implementation Status

**File Metrics** (/home/benjamin/.config/.claude/commands/supervise.md):
- **Total Lines**: 2,274 lines
- **Code Fences**: 90 code blocks (all bash, no YAML documentation blocks)
- **Enforcement Language**: 40+ instances of YOU MUST/MANDATORY/CRITICAL
- **EXECUTE NOW Directives**: 17 instances
- **Agent Invocations**: 6 (research, planning, implementation, testing, debug, documentation)

**Standard 0 - Execution Enforcement (COMPLIANT)**:
- ✅ Imperative language used throughout (MUST, MANDATORY, CRITICAL)
- ✅ Sequential step dependencies clearly marked ("STEP 1 (REQUIRED BEFORE STEP 2)")
- ✅ Verification checkpoints explicit with bash conditional syntax
- ✅ Fallback mechanisms implemented with proper distinction (bootstrap removed, file creation verification retained)
- ✅ Pattern: "EXECUTE NOW - [action]" used for all critical operations
- Evidence: Lines 237-376 (library sourcing with fail-fast errors), lines 1075-1198 (research verification with retry logic)

**Standard 11 - Imperative Agent Invocation Pattern (FULLY COMPLIANT)**:
- ✅ All 6 agent invocations use imperative instructions
- ✅ Format: `**EXECUTE NOW**: USE the Task tool with these parameters:`
- ✅ No YAML code block wrappers around Task invocations (using bullet-point format instead)
- ✅ All invocations reference agent behavioral files (research-specialist.md, plan-architect.md, etc.)
- ✅ Completion signals explicitly required (Return: REPORT_CREATED, PLAN_CREATED, etc.)
- ✅ No undermining disclaimers after imperative directives
- Evidence: Lines 1050-1073 (research phase), 1332-1351 (planning phase), 1528-1547 (implementation phase)

**Standard 12 - Structural vs Behavioral Content Separation (COMPLIANT)**:
- ✅ Structural templates inline: Task invocation syntax (lines 1050-1073), bash blocks with complete commands
- ✅ Behavioral content referenced: Agent files via "Read and follow ALL behavioral guidelines from"
- ✅ Context injection pattern applied: Workflow-specific context injected into agent prompts
- ✅ Single source of truth: Agent behavioral guidelines exist only in .claude/agents/ files
- Evidence: All 6 agent invocations use structure "Read and follow... from .claude/agents/[name].md"

**Architectural Prohibition Compliance (CRITICAL - FULLY COMPLIANT)**:
- ✅ Role clarification present: "YOU ARE THE ORCHESTRATOR" (line 9)
- ✅ Anti-execution instructions: "YOU MUST NEVER execute tasks yourself" (line 19-24)
- ✅ Zero SlashCommand invocations to other commands (/plan, /implement, /debug, /document)
- ✅ Direct agent invocation pattern (Task tool only, never SlashCommand)
- ✅ Complete section devoted to prohibition (lines 42-109)
- ✅ Side-by-side comparison table showing correct vs incorrect patterns
- Evidence: Sections "Architectural Prohibition" and "No Command Chaining" explicitly document this

**Behavioral Injection Pattern (COMPLIANT)**:
- ✅ Phase 0 implements path pre-calculation (lines 637-987)
- ✅ Context injection via prompt parameters (workflow description, report paths, standards file)
- ✅ No command-to-command invocations (no SlashCommand tool usage)
- ✅ Clear role separation (orchestrator vs executor agents)
- Evidence: Lines 1057-1062 show context injection structure with pre-calculated paths

**Reference Pattern (COMPLIANT)**:
- ✅ Inline instructions present BEFORE references
- ✅ References marked with [REFERENCE-OK] and [EXECUTION-CRITICAL] annotations
- ✅ Core execution procedures not externalized
- Evidence: Line 113 "[REFERENCE-OK: Can be supplemented...]", line 235 "[EXECUTION-CRITICAL...]"

**File Organization and Standards (COMPLIANT)**:
- ✅ File size: 2,274 lines (within acceptable range, >300 minimum)
- ✅ Phase structure clearly organized with numbered sections
- ✅ Critical patterns marked with annotations
- ✅ Bootstrap errors use fail-fast with diagnostic messages
- Evidence: Lines 199-214 show fail-fast error handling philosophy

### Verification and Fallback Implementation

The command implements a comprehensive verification-fallback pattern:

**Research Phase Verification** (Lines 1075-1198):
- Explicit verification loop for all report files
- Single-retry mechanism for transient errors (retry_with_backoff function)
- Quality checks (file size, markdown headers)
- Partial failure handling (continue if ≥50% success)
- Progress marker emission at each verification step

**Plan Phase Verification** (Lines 1352-1434):
- MANDATORY VERIFICATION checkpoint
- Auto-recovery with single retry
- Quality checks (phase count, metadata section)
- Fail-fast on permanent errors
- Checkpoint save after successful verification

**Error Handling Enhancements** (Lines 195-214):
- Error location extraction (file:line parsing)
- Error type categorization (timeout, syntax, dependency)
- Context-specific recovery suggestions
- Diagnostic commands included in error output

## Recommendations

### 1. Strengthen Phase 0 Bootstrap Logging

**Finding**: While fail-fast error handling is good (lines 199-214), the library sourcing section (lines 237-376) could emit progress markers before attempting to source each library.

**Recommendation**: Add progress emission before each library sourcing attempt to provide visibility into bootstrap sequence:
```bash
emit_progress "0" "Sourcing workflow-detection.sh..."
source "$SCRIPT_DIR/../lib/workflow-detection.sh" || { [error handling] }
```
**Benefit**: Improved diagnostics when bootstrap fails midway through library sequence
**Impact**: +50 lines, minimal (enables faster debugging)

### 2. Document Phase 0 Output Expectations

**Finding**: Phase 0 output in lines 637-987 is complex but undocumented in terms of what variables should be available after Phase 0 completes.

**Recommendation**: Add explicit section documenting Phase 0 output contract:
```markdown
## Phase 0 Output Contract

After Phase 0 completion, the following variables MUST be available for subsequent phases:
- TOPIC_PATH: Absolute path to topic directory
- REPORT_PATHS[@]: Array of pre-calculated report paths
- PLAN_PATH: Absolute path for implementation plan
- SUMMARY_PATH: Absolute path for workflow summary
- WORKFLOW_SCOPE: Detected workflow type (research-only, research-and-plan, etc.)
```
**Benefit**: Clear checkpoint definition enabling easier debugging
**Impact**: +10 lines documentation, no behavioral change

### 3. Enhance Verification Error Messages with Artifact Paths

**Finding**: Verification sections (e.g., lines 1075-1198) emit progress markers but don't always include the expected artifact path in error context.

**Recommendation**: Include full artifact path context in all verification error messages:
```bash
echo "ERROR: Research report $i missing at $REPORT_PATH"
echo "   Expected path: $REPORT_PATH"
echo "   Actual directory: $(ls -d $(dirname $REPORT_PATH) 2>/dev/null || echo 'MISSING')"
```
**Benefit**: Faster debugging when file creation fails
**Impact**: +5 lines per verification section

### 4. Add Delegation Rate Validation

**Finding**: While Standard 11 compliance is strong, there's no inline validation that agent invocations actually execute.

**Recommendation**: Add delegation rate check after Phase 1 research:
```bash
EXPECTED_AGENTS=$RESEARCH_COMPLEXITY
ACTUAL_PROGRESS_MARKERS=$(grep -c "PROGRESS:" <<< "$command_output")
if [ "$ACTUAL_PROGRESS_MARKERS" -lt "$EXPECTED_AGENTS" ]; then
  echo "WARNING: Delegation rate <100% ($ACTUAL_PROGRESS_MARKERS/$EXPECTED_AGENTS agents executed)"
fi
```
**Benefit**: Catch agent delegation failures immediately
**Impact**: +15 lines diagnostic code

### 5. Document Context Window Usage Targets

**Finding**: Performance targets mentioned (line 161: "<25% context usage") but no inline documentation of how context is managed.

**Recommendation**: Add section explaining context reduction strategy:
```markdown
## Context Management Strategy

- Phase 0-N: Metadata-only passing between orchestrator and agents
- Target: <25% context usage through forward message pattern
- Achieved: [actual measurement from implementation]
- Mechanism: Research reports referenced by path, not loaded into context
```
**Benefit**: Transparency into performance design decisions
**Impact**: +10 lines documentation
