## Executive Summary

The implementation plan for spec 497 demonstrates strong compliance with documentation standards, particularly in avoiding temporal language and maintaining present-focused content. The plan contains NO violations of banned temporal markers (New, Old, Updated), uses imperative language consistently throughout task descriptions, and maintains UTF-8 character encoding without emojis. However, the Revision History section (lines 1287-1335) contains appropriate historical documentation that belongs in this dedicated section per standards guidelines.

## Findings

### 1. Imperative Language Compliance (PASS)

**Standard**: All required actions must use MUST/WILL/SHALL (never should/may/can) - See CLAUDE.md Imperative Language Guide

**Analysis**:
- Plan uses imperative phrasing consistently: "YOU MUST", "EXECUTE NOW", "ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENT"
- Task descriptions use imperative mood: "Create validation script", "Fix Research Phase", "Remove fallback functions"
- Success criteria use checkboxes with clear verification statements
- No weak modal verbs (should, may, can) found in requirement specifications

**Examples** (lines 246-252):
```markdown
- [ ] Create validation script: `.claude/lib/validate-agent-invocation-pattern.sh`
  - Detect YAML-style Task blocks in command files
  - Detect markdown code fences (` ```yaml `, ` ```bash `) around Task invocations
  - Detect template variables in agent prompts (`${VAR}`)
  - Report violations with line numbers and context
  - Exit code 0 for pass, 1 for violations found
```

**Verdict**: COMPLIANT - All tasks use imperative language as required.

### 2. Present-Focused Content (PASS)

**Standard**: Document current implementation accurately and clearly. No historical reporting, focus on what the system does now. - See writing-standards.md lines 48-58

**Analysis**:
- Plan content describes current state and planned changes without historical markers
- Technical descriptions focus on "what will be" or "what is" rather than "what was"
- Architecture overview (lines 108-174) describes system layers in present/future tense
- Testing strategy describes verification approaches without referencing past implementations

**Examples** (lines 108-128):
```markdown
### Architecture Overview

The unified plan addresses three layers of orchestration command reliability:

**Layer 1: Fail-Fast Error Handling** (/supervise focus)
- Clear error messages when library sourcing fails
- Function verification with helpful diagnostics showing which library provides each function
- Remove all fallback mechanisms (workflow-detection.sh, directory creation)
- Explicit errors enable consistent debugging
```

**Verdict**: COMPLIANT - Content is present-focused and describes planned state clearly.

### 3. Banned Temporal Markers (PASS)

**Standard**: Never use labels like "(New)", "(Old)", "(Original)", "(Current)", "(Updated)", or version indicators in feature descriptions - See writing-standards.md lines 79-105

**Analysis**: Comprehensive scan of plan document reveals ZERO occurrences of banned temporal markers in feature descriptions.

**Search Results**:
- "(New)" - 0 occurrences
- "(Old)" - 0 occurrences
- "(Updated)" - 0 occurrences
- "(Current)" - 0 occurrences
- "(Deprecated)" - 0 occurrences
- "(Original)" - 0 occurrences
- "(Legacy)" - 0 occurrences

**Verdict**: COMPLIANT - No banned temporal markers present.

### 4. Temporal Phrases (PASS WITH NOTE)

**Standard**: Avoid phrases like "previously", "recently", "now supports", "used to", "no longer" - See writing-standards.md lines 107-141

**Analysis**: Document contains temporal phrases ONLY in appropriate contexts:

**Legitimate Usage** (Revision History section, lines 1287-1335):
- "Revision 1: Simplification of Phase 2" (revision documentation)
- "Reason for Revision: User feedback..." (change rationale)
- "Modified Phases" (revision tracking)

This usage is appropriate per writing-standards.md lines 309-329 which state that historical information belongs in dedicated revision history sections.

**Technical Conditionals** (legitimate usage):
- "If no longer needed" appears in conditional logic contexts (lines describing cleanup operations)
- "previously-failed tests" as technical state description (not historical commentary)

**Verdict**: COMPLIANT - Temporal phrases limited to revision history section where appropriate.

### 5. Character Encoding (PASS)

**Standard**: UTF-8 only, no emojis in file content - See nvim/CLAUDE.md lines 314-344

**Analysis**:
- File encoding: UTF-8 (verified)
- Emoji count: 0
- Unicode box-drawing characters: Used appropriately for diagrams (lines 131-174)
- Text indicators instead of emojis: Uses checkboxes `[ ]`, bullet points `•`, arrows `→`

**Example** (lines 131-174 - Architecture diagram):
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Orchestration Command Startup                               │
│                                                              │
│  1. Source Required Libraries                               │
│  2. Verify Functions (clear diagnostics on fail)            │
│  3. Detect Workflow Scope                                   │
│                                                              │
│  ──────────────── BOOTSTRAP COMPLETE ─────────────────────  │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Verdict**: COMPLIANT - UTF-8 encoding with no emojis, proper use of box-drawing characters.

### 6. Revision History Section (APPROPRIATE)

**Standard**: Historical information belongs in dedicated sections like CHANGELOG.md or revision history - See writing-standards.md lines 309-359

**Analysis**:
The plan includes a "Revision History" section (lines 1286-1335) documenting two plan revisions. This is APPROPRIATE per standards:

**From writing-standards.md lines 309-329**:
> ### CHANGELOG.md
> Version-by-version chronological record:
> ```markdown
> ## [2.0.0] - 2025-10-15
> ### Added
> - OAuth authentication support
> ```

The plan's revision history follows this pattern in a plan-specific context:

```markdown
## Revision History

### 2025-10-27 - Revision 1: Simplification of Phase 2

**Changes Made**:
- Reduced Phase 2 scope from comprehensive robustness improvements to essential error handling only

**Reason for Revision**:
User feedback: "/supervise command is working well..."

**Impact**:
- Phase 2 time reduced from 2-3 hours to 1-1.5 hours
```

**Verdict**: COMPLIANT - Revision history is segregated to dedicated section, not embedded in feature descriptions.

### 7. Example Code and Technical Descriptions (PASS)

**Standard**: All code examples must use correct syntax, actual file paths, be copy-pastable - See DOCUMENTATION_STANDARDS.md lines 166-195

**Analysis**:
- File paths are absolute and accurate: `/home/benjamin/.config/.claude/commands/coordinate.md`
- Line number references where helpful: `(approximate line 800-900)`
- Code examples use proper syntax highlighting (markdown, bash, yaml)
- Testing commands are functional and copy-pastable

**Example** (lines 278-295):
```bash
# Test validation script
./.claude/lib/validate-agent-invocation-pattern.sh .claude/commands/coordinate.md
# Expected: Violations detected (9 locations)

./.claude/lib/validate-agent-invocation-pattern.sh .claude/commands/research.md
# Expected: Violations detected (3 locations + bash code blocks)
```

**Verdict**: COMPLIANT - Examples follow documentation standards.

### 8. Plan Structure and Completeness (PASS)

**Standard**: Documentation must be accurate, complete, and include working examples - See DOCUMENTATION_STANDARDS.md lines 38-44

**Analysis**:
- Plan includes complete metadata (lines 1-15)
- Overview section clearly states objectives (lines 16-33)
- Research summary provides context (lines 34-90)
- Success criteria are specific and verifiable (lines 91-103)
- Technical design includes component interactions (lines 104-234)
- Each phase has clear tasks, testing, and completion requirements
- Testing strategy is comprehensive (lines 741-838)
- Dependencies documented (lines 901-945)

**Verdict**: COMPLIANT - Plan is well-structured and complete.

## Recommendations

### 1. Continue Current Practices

**What's Working**:
- Imperative language usage is consistent and clear
- Present-focused content maintains readability
- No temporal markers in feature descriptions
- UTF-8 encoding without emojis
- Appropriate segregation of historical content to revision history

**Action**: Maintain these standards in future plan updates and phase implementations.

### 2. Verify Generated Documentation

**Context**: Phase 5 (lines 646-740) includes extensive documentation updates across multiple files.

**Recommendation**: When implementing Phase 5 documentation tasks, apply the same standards compliance checks to generated documentation:
- Run validation script: `.claude/lib/validate_docs_timeless.sh` (referenced in writing-standards.md lines 472-512)
- Verify no temporal markers introduced
- Ensure UTF-8 encoding maintained
- Check imperative language in command documentation

**Why**: Standards compliance must extend to all documentation generated during plan execution.

### 3. Add Standards Validation to Phase 5

**Current State**: Phase 5 includes documentation updates but doesn't explicitly include standards validation.

**Recommendation**: Add explicit validation step to Phase 5, Task 5.8:
```markdown
- [ ] **Task 5.9**: Validate Documentation Standards Compliance
  - Run `.claude/lib/validate_docs_timeless.sh` on all updated files
  - Check for temporal markers in new documentation
  - Verify UTF-8 encoding maintained
  - Confirm imperative language in command documentation
  - Document validation results
```

**Why**: Proactive validation prevents standards drift during implementation.
