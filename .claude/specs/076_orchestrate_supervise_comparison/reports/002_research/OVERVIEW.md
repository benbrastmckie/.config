# Research Overview: Streamlining /supervise Project Location Detection

**Date**: 2025-10-23
**Research Topic**: Streamlining /supervise project location detection to reduce token usage
**Status**: COMPLETE

## Executive Summary

The /supervise command's location detection task consumes 75.6k tokens through the location-specialist agent, representing 38% of the 200k context window. Three research subtopics explored optimization approaches: (1) Claude API model switching to Haiku 4.5, (2) Skills architecture as an alternative to agents, and (3) direct optimization patterns for the detection logic itself.

**Key Finding**: The optimal solution combines **model switching to Haiku 4.5** (67% cost reduction, 4-5x speed increase) with **utility function pre-computation** (85-95% token reduction). Skills are NOT recommended for location detection due to temporal dependency requirements and lack of deterministic execution control.

**Token Optimization Potential**:
- Current: 75.6k tokens per invocation (Sonnet 4.5, full agent)
- With Haiku 4.5 only: 75.6k tokens, 67% cost reduction, 4-5x faster
- With utility functions only: 7.5k-11k tokens (85-95% reduction)
- Combined approach: 7.5k-11k tokens at Haiku pricing = **90% cost reduction + 85% token reduction**

**Implementation Complexity**: LOW-MEDIUM
- Model switching: Add 2 lines to agent frontmatter (5 minutes)
- Utility extraction: Create topic-utils.sh library, refactor Phase 0 (2-4 hours)

## Cross-Cutting Themes

### Theme 1: Location Detection is Over-Engineered for Its Actual Use Case

All three research subtopics independently identified the same core issue: **the location-specialist agent performs complex codebase analysis that rarely affects the final decision**.

**Evidence from Subtopic 003** (Project Detection Optimization):
- STEP 1 of location-specialist uses Grep/Glob to search codebase for related files
- This analysis determines affected directories based on keywords
- In practice: 90%+ of workflows use project root regardless of keyword analysis
- Token cost: 15,000-20,000 tokens for codebase searches that are usually ignored

**Evidence from Subtopic 002** (Skills Architecture):
- Location detection performs "deterministic workflow: directory scanning, path calculation, structure creation"
- Skills evaluation concluded: "Deterministic logic doesn't benefit from automatic activation"
- The task requires "precise orchestration timing" not "AI judgment"

**Evidence from Subtopic 001** (Model Switching):
- Task characteristics: "Read-only file system analysis, pattern matching, simple scoring algorithm"
- Classification: "No code generation required" (ideal for utility functions, not AI)
- 95% of Sonnet quality is acceptable because pattern matching is straightforward

**Synthesis**: The location-specialist agent was designed for complex, ambiguous location decisions across multi-system refactors. Actual usage patterns show simple, repetitive workflows where project root is the location 90%+ of the time. This is a classic case of premature generalization.

### Theme 2: Multiple Optimization Strategies Available with Complementary Benefits

Each subtopic identified a different optimization dimension, and these approaches **stack multiplicatively**:

**Subtopic 001: Cost & Speed Optimization** (Model Switching to Haiku 4.5)
- **Impact**: 67% cost reduction, 4-5x speed increase
- **Token usage**: SAME (75.6k tokens to Haiku instead of Sonnet)
- **Quality trade-off**: Minimal (73% vs 77% SWE-bench, acceptable for pattern matching)
- **Implementation**: Add `model: haiku-4.5` to agent frontmatter

**Subtopic 003: Token Reduction** (Utility Function Pre-computation)
- **Impact**: 85-95% token reduction (75.6k → 7.5k-11k tokens)
- **Cost/Speed**: Deterministic bash utilities (zero AI cost)
- **Quality trade-off**: None (same deterministic logic, testable)
- **Implementation**: Extract topic number calculation and directory creation to topic-utils.sh

**Combined Effect** (Haiku + Utilities):
- Token reduction: 85-95% (75.6k → 7.5k-11k tokens)
- Cost reduction: 90%+ (67% Haiku savings × 85%+ token savings)
- Speed increase: 10-20x (4-5x Haiku speed × 2-4x less processing)
- Quality: No degradation (utility functions are deterministic)

### Theme 3: Skills Are NOT a Silver Bullet for Token Optimization

Subtopic 002's in-depth Skills analysis revealed critical architectural constraints that make Skills unsuitable for orchestrated workflows like location detection:

**Progressive Disclosure Benefit** (99% reduction when dormant):
- Skills: 30-50 tokens baseline until activated
- Agents: 5000+ tokens loaded immediately
- **BUT**: This only helps when skills are NOT needed for a task

**Activation Timing Problem**:
- Skills activate when Claude determines relevance (model-invoked)
- Location detection must execute in Phase 0 before research agents in Phase 1
- Skills cannot guarantee "location detection before research execution" temporal dependency
- Quote from 002: "Skills' model-invoked activation pattern violates all four requirements [for location detection]"

**Token Efficiency Comparison** (002: Finding 6):
```
/orchestrate workflow with research → planning phases:

Current (Subagents):
- Location-specialist: 5000 tokens loaded, 250 tokens returned = 95% reduction after execution
- Research agents: 15,000 tokens loaded, 750 tokens returned
- Total: 23,000 tokens

With Skills for Standards + Subagents for Workflows:
- Skills dormant: 120 tokens (3 × 40 tokens)
- Location-specialist: 5000 tokens (retained as subagent for timing control)
- Skills activate during research: 6000 tokens (first run only)
- Total first run: 29,120 tokens (+27%)
- Total subsequent runs: 23,120 tokens (comparable)
```

**Recommendation from 002**: Use Skills for standards enforcement (auto-activate during implementation/testing), retain subagents for orchestrated workflows (location, research, planning).

### Theme 4: Existing Commands Demonstrate Simpler Patterns Already Working

Subtopic 003 discovered that /report and /plan commands achieve location detection with **1,000-2,000 tokens** (98% more efficient than /supervise) using utility functions:

**Pattern Used by /report and /plan**:
```bash
# Simple utility function (not agent)
TOPIC_DIR=$(get_or_create_topic_dir "$TOPIC_DESC" ".claude/specs")
# Creates: .claude/specs/{NNN_topic}/ with subdirectories
```

**Why This Works**:
- Topic number calculation is deterministic (ls → max → increment)
- Directory creation is standard bash (mkdir -p)
- No AI reasoning required for straightforward logic

**Fallback Pattern in /orchestrate**:
Even /orchestrate (which uses location-specialist agent) includes a fallback that proves agent is optional:
```bash
if [ ! -d "$TOPIC_PATH" ]; then
  echo "FALLBACK: location-specialist failed - creating directory structure manually"
  mkdir -p "$TOPIC_PATH"/{reports,plans,summaries,debug,scripts,outputs}
fi
```

Quote from 003: "The fallback mechanism proves that directory creation can be done directly by orchestrator without agent assistance."

### Theme 5: Model Selection Infrastructure Already Exists But Is Unutilized

Subtopic 001 uncovered a critical finding: this project has comprehensive documentation on model selection (`074_model_selection_refactor_design.md`) but **has NOT implemented it yet**.

**Existing Infrastructure**:
- Task tool supports `model` parameter for subagent invocation (verified via GitHub issues)
- Agent frontmatter supports `model: haiku-4.5` metadata (3 options: haiku, sonnet, opus)
- Decision tree for model assignment exists (read-only → Haiku, architecture → Opus, default → Sonnet)

**Current State**:
- 19 specialized agents, zero have model metadata
- All agents default to Sonnet 4.5 (system-level model)
- Implementation plan exists: 4 phases, 20-29 hours total effort

**Opportunity**:
- Add model metadata to location-specialist.md: 5 minutes
- Immediate impact: 67% cost reduction, 4-5x speed increase
- No Claude Code core changes required (Task tool already supports it)

**Quote from 001**: "Ready to implement. All 19 specialized agents need model metadata added to frontmatter. No Claude Code core changes required."

## Synthesized Recommendations

### Recommendation 1: Immediate Action - Add Haiku 4.5 Model Metadata (5 Minutes, 67% Cost Reduction)

**Priority**: CRITICAL (highest ROI per effort)
**Complexity**: TRIVIAL
**Impact**: 67% cost reduction, 4-5x speed increase, zero functionality change

**Implementation**:
Add to `/home/benjamin/.config/.claude/agents/location-specialist.md` frontmatter:
```yaml
model: haiku-4.5
model-justification: Read-only file system analysis, pattern matching, 75.6k token optimization
fallback-model: sonnet-4.5
```

**Verification**:
1. Test /supervise with dry-run to verify Haiku produces correct location detection
2. Monitor model-usage.log for cost/speed metrics
3. If quality issues emerge, fallback-model automatically engages

**Why This First**:
- Zero risk (fallback to Sonnet if issues)
- Immediate cost savings (67% reduction)
- No code changes to /supervise command
- Validates model selection infrastructure works
- Can be done while implementing other recommendations

**Rollback Plan**: Remove model metadata lines to revert to Sonnet default

**Sources**: 001 (Recommendation 1), 003 (Note on combined approach)

### Recommendation 2: Extract Topic Utilities Library (2-4 Hours, 85-95% Token Reduction)

**Priority**: HIGH (largest token impact)
**Complexity**: MEDIUM
**Impact**: 75.6k → 7.5k-11k tokens (85-95% reduction)

**Implementation**:

**Step 1**: Create `/home/benjamin/.config/.claude/lib/topic-utils.sh`:
```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

# Get next sequential topic number for specs directory
get_next_topic_number() {
  local specs_root="$1"

  # Find max existing topic number
  local max_num=$(ls -1d "${specs_root}"/[0-9][0-9][0-9]_* 2>/dev/null | \
    sed 's/.*\/\([0-9][0-9][0-9]\)_.*/\1/' | \
    sort -n | tail -1)

  # Increment
  if [ -z "$max_num" ]; then
    echo "001"
  else
    printf "%03d" $((10#$max_num + 1))
  fi
}

# Sanitize workflow description to topic name
sanitize_topic_name() {
  local raw_name="$1"
  echo "$raw_name" | \
    tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' | \
    tr ' ' '_' | \
    sed 's/[^a-z0-9_]//g' | \
    sed 's/^_*//;s/_*$//' | \
    cut -c1-50
}

# Create topic directory structure
create_topic_structure() {
  local topic_path="$1"
  mkdir -p "$topic_path"/{reports,plans,summaries,debug,scripts,outputs}

  # Verify creation
  for subdir in reports plans summaries debug scripts outputs; do
    if [ ! -d "$topic_path/$subdir" ]; then
      echo "ERROR: Failed to create $topic_path/$subdir" >&2
      return 1
    fi
  done

  return 0
}
```

**Step 2**: Update `/home/benjamin/.config/.claude/commands/supervise.md` Phase 0:

Replace location-specialist agent invocation (lines 343-520) with:
```bash
# Phase 0: Determine project location and specs structure
source "${CLAUDE_CONFIG}/.claude/lib/topic-utils.sh"
source "${CLAUDE_CONFIG}/.claude/lib/detect-project-dir.sh"

# Get project root (from detect-project-dir.sh utility)
PROJECT_ROOT="${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}"

# Determine specs directory
if [ -d "${PROJECT_ROOT}/.claude/specs" ]; then
  SPECS_ROOT="${PROJECT_ROOT}/.claude/specs"
elif [ -d "${PROJECT_ROOT}/specs" ]; then
  SPECS_ROOT="${PROJECT_ROOT}/specs"
else
  # Create default location
  SPECS_ROOT="${PROJECT_ROOT}/.claude/specs"
  mkdir -p "$SPECS_ROOT"
fi

# Calculate topic metadata
TOPIC_NUMBER=$(get_next_topic_number "$SPECS_ROOT")
TOPIC_NAME=$(sanitize_topic_name "$WORKFLOW_DESCRIPTION")
TOPIC_PATH="${SPECS_ROOT}/${TOPIC_NUMBER}_${TOPIC_NAME}"

# Create directory structure
if ! create_topic_structure "$TOPIC_PATH"; then
  echo "ERROR: Failed to create topic directory structure"
  exit 1
fi

# Generate location context (for compatibility with downstream phases)
LOCATION_CONTEXT=$(cat <<EOF
topic_number: $TOPIC_NUMBER
topic_name: $TOPIC_NAME
topic_path: $TOPIC_PATH
artifact_paths:
  reports: $TOPIC_PATH/reports
  plans: $TOPIC_PATH/plans
  summaries: $TOPIC_PATH/summaries
  debug: $TOPIC_PATH/debug
  scripts: $TOPIC_PATH/scripts
  outputs: $TOPIC_PATH/outputs
EOF
)

echo "LOCATION_DETECTED: $TOPIC_PATH"
```

**Benefits**:
- Deterministic logic (testable with unit tests)
- Zero AI token cost
- 90% faster execution (bash vs agent)
- Reusable across /report, /plan, /orchestrate

**Migration Path**: Keep location-specialist agent for complex edge cases, use utility functions as default path

**Sources**: 003 (Recommendation 2, Pattern 2), 001 (Combined strategy section)

### Recommendation 3: Hybrid Heuristic-Agent Approach for Edge Cases (Optional)

**Priority**: MEDIUM (covers rare edge cases)
**Complexity**: MEDIUM
**Impact**: Preserves accuracy for complex workflows while optimizing 90%+ common cases

**Implementation**:
Add conditional logic before utility function invocation:
```bash
needs_complex_location_analysis() {
  local workflow_desc="$1"

  # Complex workflows: multi-system refactors, migrations
  if echo "$workflow_desc" | grep -Eiq "migrate|refactor.*system|multi.*module"; then
    return 0  # true: use agent
  fi

  # Simple workflows: use utility functions
  return 1  # false: use utilities
}

if needs_complex_location_analysis "$WORKFLOW_DESCRIPTION"; then
  # Invoke location-specialist agent with Haiku 4.5 (Recommendation 1)
  Task location-specialist --model haiku-4.5
else
  # Use utility functions (Recommendation 2)
  TOPIC_NUMBER=$(get_next_topic_number "$SPECS_ROOT")
  ...
fi
```

**When to Use Agent** (10% of workflows):
- Multi-system refactors spanning nvim/ and .claude/ directories
- Migration workflows affecting multiple subdirectories
- Ambiguous scopes requiring codebase analysis

**When to Use Utilities** (90% of workflows):
- Research tasks (always project root)
- Feature additions (project root + specs/NNN_topic)
- Bug fixes (project root)

**Sources**: 003 (Recommendation 1, Pattern 3)

### Recommendation 4: DO NOT Use Skills for Location Detection

**Priority**: CRITICAL (avoid architectural regression)
**Complexity**: N/A (decision not to migrate)
**Rationale**: Skills are incompatible with location detection requirements

**Four Reasons Skills Are Unsuitable** (from 002: Finding 4):

1. **Automatic Activation Creates Timing Ambiguity**: Skills activate when Claude determines relevance. No guarantee location detection happens before research agents need to save reports.

2. **No Pre-Calculation of Paths**: Current architecture pre-calculates paths in Phase 0 and injects them into subagent prompts. Skills activate during execution, cannot provide paths beforehand.

3. **Deterministic Logic Doesn't Benefit from Auto-Activation**: Topic number calculation is deterministic (ls → max → increment). No ambiguity requiring Claude's judgment.

4. **Loss of Verification Checkpoints**: location-specialist has mandatory verification at each step. Skills' autonomous activation prevents orchestrator monitoring.

**Where Skills ARE Recommended**:
- Standards enforcement (code-standards, testing-protocols, doc-standards)
- Automatic quality gates during implementation
- Reusable methodologies (TDD workflows, debugging patterns)

**Action**: Document this decision in `.claude/docs/guides/skills-vs-subagents-decision.md` to prevent future migration attempts.

**Sources**: 002 (Recommendation 1, Finding 4)

### Recommendation 5: Standardize Location Detection Across All Commands

**Priority**: LOW (enables future optimization)
**Complexity**: HIGH
**Impact**: Single source of truth for location logic, consistent behavior

**Implementation**:
1. Create `/home/benjamin/.config/.claude/lib/unified-location-detection.sh` combining:
   - `detect-project-dir.sh` (project root)
   - `topic-utils.sh` (specs structure)
   - Heuristic logic for subdirectory detection
2. Migrate /report, /plan, /orchestrate, /supervise to use unified library
3. Deprecate location-specialist agent for routine workflows

**Benefits**:
- Optimize once, benefit everywhere
- Consistent behavior across commands
- Easier maintenance
- Testable with comprehensive unit tests

**Phased Approach**:
- Phase 1: Implement for /supervise (Recommendation 2)
- Phase 2: Migrate /orchestrate
- Phase 3: Refactor /report and /plan (already use utilities, just standardize)
- Phase 4: Create unified library from extracted patterns

**Sources**: 003 (Recommendation 5)

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Immediate Wins (Day 1: 5 Minutes + 2-4 Hours)

**Morning** (5 minutes):
1. Add Haiku 4.5 metadata to location-specialist.md (Recommendation 1)
2. Test /supervise with sample workflow
3. Verify 67% cost reduction in logs

**Afternoon** (2-4 hours):
1. Create topic-utils.sh library (Recommendation 2)
2. Refactor /supervise Phase 0 to use utilities
3. Add unit tests for utility functions
4. Verify 85-95% token reduction

**Expected Outcome**: 90% cost reduction + 85% token reduction operational

### Phase 2: System-Wide Model Selection (Week 1: 8-12 Hours)

Following Report 074's implementation plan:
1. Add model metadata to 18 remaining agents (4-6 hours)
   - Haiku 4.5: complexity-estimator, metrics-specialist, code-reviewer (3 agents)
   - Opus 4.1: plan-architect, expansion-specialist, collapse-specialist (3 agents)
   - Sonnet 4.5: research, implementation, debugging, documentation (11 agents)
2. Create model selection utilities (2-3 hours)
3. Update all 20 commands to use model selection (3-4 hours)
4. Validation and testing (2-3 hours)

**Expected Outcome**: 20% overall cost reduction, 32% time reduction across all workflows

### Phase 3: Standardization (Week 2: 6-8 Hours)

1. Create unified-location-detection.sh (2-3 hours)
2. Migrate /orchestrate to use utilities (2-3 hours)
3. Refactor /report and /plan for consistency (1-2 hours)
4. Documentation and tests (1-2 hours)

**Expected Outcome**: Single source of truth for location logic, consistent behavior

### Phase 4: Skills Adoption for Standards Enforcement (Week 3: 4-6 Hours)

Following Recommendation 2 from subtopic 002:
1. Create 3 meta-level enforcement skills:
   - code-standards-enforcement
   - testing-protocols-enforcement
   - documentation-standards-enforcement
2. Install obra/superpowers community skills (1 hour)
3. Measure token impact and activation patterns (1-2 hours)
4. Document skills vs subagents decision criteria (1 hour)

**Expected Outcome**: Automatic consistency without command overhead

## Cost-Benefit Analysis

- **Invocation frequency**: 30% of total agent invocations
- **Cost reduction**: 20% overall (Haiku on high-frequency tasks)
- **Time savings**: 25-35% overall

**Annual System-Wide Savings** (hypothetical 10,000 agent invocations):
- Current cost: $6,800
- With model selection: $5,440
- **Savings**: $1,360/year

**System-Wide Implementation** (20-29 hours): $1,360/year savings = $47-$68 per hour

**Conclusion**: Extremely high ROI justifies immediate implementation.

## Monitoring and Validation

### Success Metrics

**Token Reduction** (Recommendation 2):
- Baseline: 75.6k tokens per /supervise invocation
- Target: <11k tokens (85%+ reduction)
- Measurement: Parse tool usage logs, sum token counts

**Cost Reduction** (Recommendation 1):
- Baseline: $0.680 per invocation (Sonnet 4.5)
- Target: <$0.034 per invocation (Haiku 4.5 + utilities)
- Measurement: Log model usage to .claude/data/logs/model-usage.log

**Execution Speed**:
- Baseline: 25.2 seconds
- Target: <1 second (20x speedup)
- Measurement: Time Phase 0 execution

**Quality Validation**:
- Test 50 diverse workflows (research, features, bugs, refactors)
- Verify 100% correct location detection
- Verify all 6 subdirectories created
- Verify absolute paths in location_context

### Logging Infrastructure

**Create**: `.claude/data/logs/location-detection.log`
```bash
# Log format
2025-10-23 14:32:15 | /supervise | utility-functions | haiku-4.5 | 8.2k tokens | 0.7s | LOCATION: specs/082_auth
```

**Track**:
- Timestamp
- Command invoked
- Method used (agent vs utilities)
- Model (if agent)
- Token count
- Execution time
- Location detected

**Aggregation Script**: `.claude/scripts/location_detection_dashboard.sh`
- Average tokens by method (agent vs utilities)
- Cost trends over time
- Edge cases requiring agent fallback
- Quality metrics (correct vs incorrect detections)

### Rollback Triggers

**If ANY of these occur, revert to location-specialist agent**:
1. Incorrect location detected (false positive/negative)
2. Missing subdirectories after creation
3. Relative paths instead of absolute paths
4. Race conditions in concurrent /orchestrate invocations

**Rollback Process**:
1. Remove utility function calls from Phase 0
2. Restore location-specialist invocation
3. Keep Haiku 4.5 model metadata (still 67% cost savings)
4. Investigate root cause before re-attempting optimization
