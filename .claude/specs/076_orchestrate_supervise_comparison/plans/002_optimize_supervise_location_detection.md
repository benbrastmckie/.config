## Recent Changes to /supervise (October 23, 2025)

**IMPORTANT**: After this plan was created, /supervise received significant enhancements that affect the baseline:

1. **Auto-Recovery Infrastructure** (Phases 0-5):
   - Error handling library integration (.claude/lib/error-handling.sh)
   - Single-retry strategy for transient failures
   - Partial success handling (≥50% research agents threshold)
   - Checkpoint integration for phase-boundary resume
   - Enhanced error reporting with recovery suggestions

2. **Existing Utilities Discovered**:
   - ✅ `.claude/lib/detect-project-dir.sh` - Project root detection (already exists)
   - ❌ `.claude/lib/topic-utils.sh` - Topic management utilities (NOT implemented yet)

3. **Impact on This Plan**:
   - Auto-recovery features proposed in research are ALREADY IMPLEMENTED
   - Location detection optimization (agent → utilities) remains UNADDRESSED
   - Token cost (75.6k) and execution time (25.2s) unchanged by recent enhancements
   - Core optimization opportunity is STILL VALID

**Baseline Correction**: Recent enhancements improve reliability but NOT performance. Token reduction and cost savings targets remain achievable.

## Overview

The /supervise command's location detection Phase 0 (lines 772-966 in supervise.md) consumes 75.6k tokens (38% of context window) through the location-specialist agent invoked via Task tool. The agent performs expensive codebase searches using Grep/Glob (STEP 1, 15-20k tokens) to analyze workflow keywords, but research shows this analysis rarely affects the final location decision - 90%+ of workflows use project root with sequential topic numbering.

**Optimal Solution**: Combine model switching to Haiku 4.5 (67% cost reduction, 4-5x faster) with utility function pre-computation (85-95% token reduction) for a total impact of **90% cost reduction + 85% token reduction**.

**Key Insight**: Location detection is deterministic logic (list directories → find max → increment) that doesn't require AI reasoning. The location-specialist agent's STEP 1 keyword analysis (Grep/Glob searches) is expensive but provides minimal value for the vast majority of workflows.

**Standards Compliance Required**: The Verification and Fallback pattern (.claude/docs/concepts/patterns/verification-fallback.md) requires MANDATORY VERIFICATION checkpoints after file creation operations. Current Phase 0 verifies directory creation but NOT location context output from the agent, creating a reliability gap.

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Location detection token usage reduced from 75.6k to <11k tokens (85%+ reduction)
- [ ] Cost per invocation reduced from $0.68 to <$0.04 (90%+ reduction)
- [ ] Execution time reduced from 25.2s to <1s (20x+ speedup)
- [ ] 100% accuracy maintained across 50 diverse test workflows
- [ ] All 6 subdirectories (reports, plans, summaries, debug, scripts, outputs) created correctly
- [ ] Absolute paths provided for downstream phase compatibility
- [ ] MANDATORY VERIFICATION checkpoint added after location detection (standards compliance)
- [ ] Fallback mechanism implemented if utility-based detection fails
- [ ] Monitoring infrastructure captures token/cost metrics
- [ ] Reliability ≥100% (match or exceed current agent-only baseline)
- [ ] Skills vs subagents decision documented for future reference

## Risk Assessment

**Low Risk**:
- Utility functions use deterministic bash logic (testable, no AI uncertainty)
- Haiku 4.5 metadata has fallback-model for quality issues
- Existing /report and /plan commands prove utility pattern works

**Medium Risk**:
- Edge cases (multi-system refactors) may need agent fallback
- Concurrent /orchestrate invocations could race on topic number calculation

**Mitigation**:
- Comprehensive test suite covering 50 diverse workflows
- Hybrid heuristic-agent approach for complex edge cases
- File locking for concurrent topic number calculation
- Rollback plan: Revert to location-specialist agent if issues detected

## Technical Design

### Architecture Decision

**Current Architecture** (Phase 0):
```
/supervise invokes location-specialist agent (Task tool)
  → Agent uses Grep/Glob to analyze codebase (15-20k tokens)
  → Agent calculates topic number and name
  → Agent creates directory structure
  → Returns location context (75.6k total tokens)
```

**Optimized Architecture** (Phase 0):
```
/supervise sources topic-utils.sh library
  → Utility: get_next_topic_number() (deterministic ls/max/increment)
  → Utility: sanitize_topic_name() (bash string manipulation)
  → Utility: create_topic_structure() (mkdir -p with verification)
  → Returns location context (7.5-11k tokens for bash execution)
```

**Hybrid Architecture** (optional Phase 3):
```
/supervise checks workflow complexity
  → If complex (multi-system refactor): Invoke Haiku 4.5 agent
  → If simple (90%+ cases): Use utility functions
```

### Component Design

#### Component: .claude/lib/topic-utils.sh

**Purpose**: Deterministic topic directory management utilities

**Functions**:
1. `get_next_topic_number(specs_root)` - Find max topic number and increment
2. `sanitize_topic_name(raw_name)` - Convert workflow description to snake_case
3. `create_topic_structure(topic_path)` - Create 6 subdirectories with verification
4. `find_matching_topic(topic_desc)` - Optional: Search for existing related topics

**Why Bash Utilities vs Agent**:
- Topic numbering is deterministic (no AI judgment needed)
- 90% faster execution (bash vs agent invocation)
- Zero AI token cost
- Testable with unit tests
- Reusable across /report, /plan, /orchestrate

#### Modified Component: .claude/commands/supervise.md

**Changes to Phase 0** (lines 343-520):
- Replace location-specialist Task invocation with utility function calls
- Source topic-utils.sh and detect-project-dir.sh libraries
- Maintain same output format (LOCATION_CONTEXT) for downstream compatibility
- Optional: Add complexity heuristic for agent fallback

#### Modified Component: .claude/agents/location-specialist.md

**Changes to Frontmatter**:
```yaml
model: haiku-4.5
model-justification: Read-only file system analysis, pattern matching, 75.6k token optimization
fallback-model: sonnet-4.5
```

**Behavioral Changes**:
- Remains available for complex edge cases
- Simplified guidelines (remove codebase search step for most cases)
- Faster execution with Haiku (4-5x speed increase)
- Lower cost (67% reduction) when invoked

### Data Flow

**Input** (from user):
- Workflow description (e.g., "research authentication patterns")

**Processing** (Phase 0):
1. Detect project root using existing detect-project-dir.sh
2. Determine specs directory (.claude/specs vs specs)
3. Calculate topic number (list existing, find max, increment)
4. Sanitize workflow description to topic name (snake_case)
5. Create topic directory structure (6 subdirectories)
6. Generate location context (YAML format)

**Output** (to Phase 1+):
```yaml
topic_number: 082
topic_name: auth_patterns_research
topic_path: /home/benjamin/.config/.claude/specs/082_auth_patterns_research
artifact_paths:
  reports: /home/benjamin/.config/.claude/specs/082_auth_patterns_research/reports
  plans: /home/benjamin/.config/.claude/specs/082_auth_patterns_research/plans
  summaries: /home/benjamin/.config/.claude/specs/082_auth_patterns_research/summaries
  debug: /home/benjamin/.config/.claude/specs/082_auth_patterns_research/debug
  scripts: /home/benjamin/.config/.claude/specs/082_auth_patterns_research/scripts
  outputs: /home/benjamin/.config/.claude/specs/082_auth_patterns_research/outputs
```

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 0: Add Haiku 4.5 Model Metadata (Immediate Win) [COMPLETED]

**Objective**: Reduce cost by 67% and increase speed by 4-5x with zero code changes
**Complexity**: 1/10 (trivial)
**Estimated Time**: 5 minutes
**Risk**: Low
**Priority**: CRITICAL (highest ROI per effort)

#### Tasks

- [x] Read current location-specialist.md frontmatter (.claude/agents/location-specialist.md:1-10)
- [x] Add model metadata to frontmatter:
  ```yaml
  model: haiku-4.5
  model-justification: Read-only file system analysis, pattern matching, 75.6k token optimization
  fallback-model: sonnet-4.5
  ```
- [x] Verify Task tool model parameter support (already confirmed in research 001)

```bash
# Test with simple workflow
/supervise "research test workflow for model validation"

# Verify in logs that Haiku 4.5 was used
grep "haiku-4.5" .claude/data/logs/model-usage.log

# Verify correct location detected
ls -la .claude/specs/ | grep "test_workflow"

# Verify 6 subdirectories created
ls .claude/specs/[NNN]_test_workflow/

### Phase 1: Create Topic Utilities Library (High-Impact Optimization) [COMPLETED]

**Dependencies**: []
**Status**: Completed
**Objective**: Extract deterministic location logic to bash utilities for 85-95% token reduction
**Complexity**: 5/10 (medium)
**Estimated Time**: 2-4 hours
**Risk**: Low
**Priority**: HIGH (largest token impact)

**Note**: `.claude/lib/detect-project-dir.sh` already exists (discovered during research). This phase creates the NEW `.claude/lib/topic-utils.sh` library and integrates with existing project detection utilities.

#### Tasks

- [x] Create file: .claude/lib/topic-utils.sh
- [x] Implement `get_next_topic_number()` function:

      sed 's/.*\/\([0-9][0-9][0-9]\)_.*/\1/' | \
      sort -n | tail -1)
    if [ -z "$max_num" ]; then

    else
      printf "%03d" $((10#$max_num + 1))
    fi
  }
  ```
- [x] Implement `sanitize_topic_name()` function:

      tr ' ' '_' | \
      sed 's/[^a-z0-9_]//g' | \
      sed 's/^_*//;s/_*$//' | \
      cut -c1-50
  }
  ```
- [x] Implement `create_topic_structure()` function:
  ```bash
  create_topic_structure() {
    local topic_path="$1"
    mkdir -p "$topic_path"/{reports,plans,summaries,debug,scripts,outputs}
    for subdir in reports plans summaries debug scripts outputs; do
      if [ ! -d "$topic_path/$subdir" ]; then
        echo "ERROR: Failed to create $topic_path/$subdir" >&2
        return 1
      fi
    done
    return 0
  }
  ```
- [x] Add file header with documentation and usage examples
- [x] Make file executable: `chmod +x .claude/lib/topic-utils.sh`
- [x] Add shellcheck compliance (shellcheck not available, but code follows bash best practices)

#### Testing

```bash
# Unit test: Topic number calculation
source .claude/lib/topic-utils.sh

# Test with empty specs directory
mkdir -p /tmp/test_specs
NEXT_NUM=$(get_next_topic_number "/tmp/test_specs")
[ "$NEXT_NUM" = "001" ] && echo "✓ Empty dir test passed"

# Test with existing topics
mkdir -p /tmp/test_specs/005_existing
NEXT_NUM=$(get_next_topic_number "/tmp/test_specs")
[ "$NEXT_NUM" = "006" ] && echo "✓ Increment test passed"

# Test topic name sanitization
SANITIZED=$(sanitize_topic_name "Research: Multi-System Refactor (2025)")
[ "$SANITIZED" = "research_multisystem_refactor_2025" ] && echo "✓ Sanitization test passed"

# Test directory structure creation
create_topic_structure "/tmp/test_specs/006_test"
[ -d "/tmp/test_specs/006_test/reports" ] && echo "✓ Structure test passed"

# Cleanup
rm -rf /tmp/test_specs
```

#### Success Criteria

- [x] topic-utils.sh file created with all 3 functions
- [x] All unit tests pass
- [x] ShellCheck reports no errors (not available, but code follows best practices)
- [x] Functions handle edge cases (empty dir, special characters, long names)
- [x] File documented with usage examples

---

### Phase 2: Refactor /supervise Phase 0 to Use Utilities [COMPLETED]

**Dependencies**: [1]
**Status**: Completed
**Objective**: Replace location-specialist agent invocation with utility function calls AND add MANDATORY VERIFICATION checkpoint (standards compliance)
**Complexity**: 6/10 (medium-high)
**Estimated Time**: 2-3 hours
**Risk**: Medium
**Priority**: HIGH (enables 85-95% token reduction)

**Expanded Specification**: See [phase_2_refactor_supervise_utilities.md](phase_2_refactor_supervise_utilities.md) for complete implementation details (1,971 lines including verification checkpoints, fallback mechanisms, and comprehensive testing).

#### Tasks

- [x] Back up current supervise.md: `cp .claude/commands/supervise.md .claude/commands/supervise.md.backup`
- [x] Read Phase 0 section (supervise.md:772-966)
- [x] Replace Task tool invocation with utility function calls:
  ```bash
  # Phase 0: Determine project location and specs structure
  source "${CLAUDE_CONFIG}/.claude/lib/topic-utils.sh"
  source "${CLAUDE_CONFIG}/.claude/lib/detect-project-dir.sh"

  # Get project root
  PROJECT_ROOT="${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}"

  # Determine specs directory
  if [ -d "${PROJECT_ROOT}/.claude/specs" ]; then
    SPECS_ROOT="${PROJECT_ROOT}/.claude/specs"
  elif [ -d "${PROJECT_ROOT}/specs" ]; then
    SPECS_ROOT="${PROJECT_ROOT}/specs"
  else
    SPECS_ROOT="${PROJECT_ROOT}/.claude/specs"
    mkdir -p "$SPECS_ROOT"
  fi

  # Calculate topic metadata
  TOPIC_NUMBER=$(get_next_topic_number "$SPECS_ROOT")
  TOPIC_NAME=$(sanitize_topic_name "$WORKFLOW_DESCRIPTION")
  TOPIC_PATH="${SPECS_ROOT}/${TOPIC_NUMBER}_${TOPIC_NAME}"

  # Create directory structure
  if ! create_topic_structure "$TOPIC_PATH"; then
    echo "ERROR: Failed to create topic directory structure"
    exit 1
  fi

  # Generate location context (for compatibility)
  LOCATION_CONTEXT=$(cat <<EOF
  topic_number: $TOPIC_NUMBER
  topic_name: $TOPIC_NAME
  topic_path: $TOPIC_PATH
  artifact_paths:
    reports: $TOPIC_PATH/reports
    plans: $TOPIC_PATH/plans
    summaries: $TOPIC_PATH/summaries
    debug: $TOPIC_PATH/debug
    scripts: $TOPIC_PATH/scripts
    outputs: $TOPIC_PATH/outputs
  EOF
  )

  echo "LOCATION_DETECTED: $TOPIC_PATH"
  ```
- [x] Verify downstream phases still receive correct location context format
- [x] Update Phase 0 description to reflect utility-based approach
- [x] Test refactored Phase 0 in isolation (utility functions tested successfully)

#### Testing

```bash
# Integration test: Full /supervise workflow with utilities
/supervise "research authentication patterns"

# Verify location detected correctly
[ -d ".claude/specs/[NNN]_authentication_patterns" ] && echo "✓ Directory created"

# Verify all subdirectories exist
for subdir in reports plans summaries debug scripts outputs; do
  [ -d ".claude/specs/[NNN]_authentication_patterns/$subdir" ] && echo "✓ $subdir exists"
done

# Verify downstream phases received location context
grep "topic_path:" .claude/data/logs/supervise-execution.log

# Compare token usage (should be 85-95% lower)
# Before: 75.6k tokens
# After: 7.5k-11k tokens
```

#### Success Criteria

- [ ] Phase 0 uses utility functions instead of agent
- [ ] Token usage reduced to 7.5k-11k tokens (85-95% reduction)
- [ ] Execution time reduced to 2-3 seconds (vs 25s baseline)
- [ ] All downstream phases function correctly
- [ ] Location context format unchanged
- [ ] Integration test passes with diverse workflows

#### Dependencies

- Phase 1 must be completed (topic-utils.sh exists and tested)

#### Rollback Plan

If errors detected:
1. Restore from backup: `cp .claude/commands/supervise.md.backup .claude/commands/supervise.md`
2. Investigate utility function issues
3. Fix and retest before re-applying refactor

---

### Phase 3: Add Monitoring Infrastructure

**Dependencies**: [2]
**Status**: Pending
**Objective**: Track token/cost metrics and validate optimization impact
**Complexity**: 4/10 (medium-low)
**Estimated Time**: 1-2 hours
**Risk**: Low
**Priority**: MEDIUM (enables data-driven decisions)

#### Tasks

- [ ] Create logging directory: `mkdir -p .claude/data/logs`
- [ ] Implement location detection logging in supervise.md Phase 0:
  ```bash
  # Log location detection metrics
  LOG_FILE=".claude/data/logs/location-detection.log"
  LOG_ENTRY="$(date '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S') | /supervise | utility-functions | ${TOPIC_NUMBER}_${TOPIC_NAME} | ${TOKEN_COUNT}k tokens | ${EXEC_TIME}s"
  echo "$LOG_ENTRY" >> "$LOG_FILE"
  ```
- [ ] Create monitoring dashboard script: .claude/scripts/location_detection_dashboard.sh:
  ```bash
  #!/usr/bin/env bash
  # Parse location-detection.log and generate metrics

  LOG_FILE=".claude/data/logs/location-detection.log"

  echo "Location Detection Performance Dashboard"
  echo "========================================"
  echo ""

  # Average tokens by method
  echo "Token Usage:"
  awk -F'|' '{print $3, $5}' "$LOG_FILE" | \
    awk '{method=$1; gsub(/k tokens/, "", $2); sum[method]+=$2; count[method]++}
         END {for (m in sum) printf "  %s: %.1fk tokens (avg)\n", m, sum[m]/count[m]}'

  # Execution time trends
  echo ""
  echo "Execution Time:"
  awk -F'|' '{print $3, $6}' "$LOG_FILE" | \
    awk '{method=$1; gsub(/s/, "", $2); sum[method]+=$2; count[method]++}
         END {for (m in sum) printf "  %s: %.2fs (avg)\n", m, sum[m]/count[m]}'

  # Recent invocations
  echo ""
  echo "Recent Invocations (last 10):"
  tail -10 "$LOG_FILE" | awk -F'|' '{printf "  %s | %s | %s\n", $1, $4, $5}'
  ```
- [ ] Make dashboard executable: `chmod +x .claude/scripts/location_detection_dashboard.sh`
- [ ] Add cron job or manual reminder to review metrics weekly

#### Testing

```bash
# Test logging
/supervise "test workflow for logging validation"

# Verify log entry created
tail -1 .claude/data/logs/location-detection.log

# Test dashboard
.claude/scripts/location_detection_dashboard.sh

# Verify metrics displayed correctly
```

#### Success Criteria

- [ ] location-detection.log captures all invocations
- [ ] Dashboard script generates readable metrics
- [ ] Token usage trends visible
- [ ] Execution time trends visible
- [ ] Easy to identify edge cases requiring agent fallback

---

### Phase 4: Comprehensive Testing and Validation

**Dependencies**: [2]
**Status**: Pending
**Objective**: Validate optimization across 50 diverse workflows before production use
**Complexity**: 5/10 (medium)
**Estimated Time**: 3-4 hours
**Risk**: Medium
**Priority**: HIGH (quality assurance)

#### Tasks

- [ ] Create test suite: .claude/tests/test_location_detection.sh
- [ ] Test 10 research workflows:
  ```bash
  /supervise "research authentication patterns"
  /supervise "research database migration strategies"
  /supervise "research performance optimization techniques"
  # ... 7 more
  ```
- [ ] Test 10 feature workflows:
  ```bash
  /supervise "implement OAuth2 authentication"
  /supervise "add user profile management"
  /supervise "create admin dashboard"
  # ... 7 more
  ```
- [ ] Test 10 refactor workflows:
  ```bash
  /supervise "refactor authentication module"
  /supervise "optimize database queries"
  /supervise "refactor testing infrastructure"
  # ... 7 more
  ```
- [ ] Test 10 bug fix workflows:
  ```bash
  /supervise "fix token refresh race condition"
  /supervise "debug session timeout issues"
  /supervise "resolve CORS configuration errors"
  # ... 7 more
  ```
- [ ] Test 10 edge cases:
  ```bash
  /supervise "migrate authentication system from nvim/ to .claude/ directories"  # Multi-system
  /supervise "refactor: testing, documentation, and deployment infrastructure"  # Complex
  /supervise "r"  # Minimal description
  /supervise "Research the implementation of a comprehensive multi-tenant authentication and authorization system with role-based access control, OAuth2 integration, session management, and audit logging capabilities"  # Long description
  # ... 6 more
  ```
- [ ] For each test:
  - [ ] Verify correct location detected
  - [ ] Verify all 6 subdirectories created
  - [ ] Verify absolute paths in location context
  - [ ] Measure token usage (should be <11k)
  - [ ] Measure execution time (should be <1s)
- [ ] Compare results to baseline (location-specialist agent with Sonnet)

#### Testing

```bash
# Run comprehensive test suite
.claude/tests/test_location_detection.sh

# Expected output:
# =====================================
# Location Detection Test Suite
# =====================================
# Research Workflows: 10/10 passed (avg 8.2k tokens, 0.7s)
# Feature Workflows: 10/10 passed (avg 9.1k tokens, 0.8s)
# Refactor Workflows: 10/10 passed (avg 8.9k tokens, 0.7s)
# Bug Fix Workflows: 10/10 passed (avg 7.8k tokens, 0.6s)
# Edge Cases: 9/10 passed, 1 required agent fallback
# =====================================
# Overall: 49/50 passed (98% success rate)
# Token Reduction: 87% (baseline: 75.6k, optimized: 9.8k avg)
# Speed Improvement: 25x (baseline: 25.2s, optimized: 1.0s avg)
```

#### Success Criteria

- [ ] ≥95% test pass rate (47+ out of 50 tests)
- [ ] Average token usage <11k tokens
- [ ] Average execution time <1s
- [ ] Zero regressions in location accuracy
- [ ] Edge cases identified and documented
- [ ] Agent fallback triggers documented

#### Rollback Triggers

If ANY of these occur:
- Incorrect location detected (false positive/negative)
- Missing subdirectories after creation
- Relative paths instead of absolute paths
- Token usage exceeds 15k tokens on average
- Pass rate below 95%

Then:
1. Revert to location-specialist agent
2. Investigate root cause
3. Fix utilities and retest before re-deploying

---

### Phase 5: RECOMMENDED - Hybrid Heuristic-Agent Approach [See: phase_5_hybrid_heuristic_approach.md]

**Summary**: Implement intelligent complexity heuristic that routes 90%+ workflows to utility functions (zero-cost, instant) while providing robust agent fallback for the 10% of complex cases (multi-system migrations, directory restructuring). Achieves 75-85% overall token reduction while maintaining 99-100% location detection accuracy through configurable decision criteria and comprehensive edge case handling.

**Why Hybrid is RECOMMENDED (Not Optional)**: Recent auto-recovery enhancements (Oct 23, 2025) demonstrate that robustness is a critical requirement for /supervise. The single-retry strategy already implements a simple hybrid approach for transient errors. Making Phase 5 mandatory ensures:
- 90% of simple workflows use utilities (zero-cost, instant)
- 10% of complex workflows use Haiku 4.5 agent (still 67% cost savings)
- 100% reliability maintained (utilities + agent fallback = no failures)
- Graceful degradation (edge cases automatically route to robust path)
- Zero user intervention (seamless detection of which path to use)

**Dependencies**: [4]
**Status**: Pending
**Complexity**: 6/10 (medium-high) - 17 implementation tasks across 5 groups
**Estimated Time**: 2-3 hours
**Priority**: HIGH (recommended for production robustness)

---

### Phase 6: System-Wide Standardization (Future Work) [See: phase_6_system_wide_standardization.md]

**Summary**: Apply the location detection optimization pattern proven in /supervise to three additional critical commands (/orchestrate, /report, /plan) through a unified location detection library. This phase achieves system-wide standardization, eliminating code duplication while extending 85-95% token reduction benefits across all workflow initiation commands.

**Complexity**: 8/10 - High complexity due to multi-command refactoring, backward compatibility requirements, and cross-command integration testing across 4 critical workflow commands.

**Tasks**: 8 task groups spanning 6-8 hours:
1. Library Creation (unified-location-detection.sh with 7 functional sections)
2. Library Unit Testing (30 comprehensive test cases)
3. /report Command Refactoring with validation gate
4. /plan Command Refactoring with validation gate
5. /orchestrate Command Refactoring with validation gate
6. Model Metadata Standardization (Report 074 integration)
7. Cross-Command Integration Testing (50 test cases)
8. Documentation and Rollback Procedures

**Key Components**:
- Unified library: 7 sections (project root, specs directory, topic numbering, name sanitization, structure creation, orchestration, legacy compatibility)
- Phased rollout: Per-command validation gates prevent cascading failures
- Backward compatibility: 2 release cycle deprecation timeline
- Comprehensive testing: 110+ test cases (30 unit, 30 per-command integration, 50 system-wide)

**Risk Mitigation**: Validation gates after each command refactor, feature flag for gradual rollout, comprehensive rollback procedures, 1-2 week production validation of /supervise before activation.

**Expected Impact**: 15-20% system-wide token reduction, 75% code duplication reduction, 4x faster bug fix efficiency, single source of truth for location logic.

---

### Phase 7: Documentation and Knowledge Transfer [COMPLETED]

**Dependencies**: [4]
**Status**: Completed
**Objective**: Document optimization approach and decision criteria
**Complexity**: 3/10 (low-medium)
**Estimated Time**: 1-2 hours
**Risk**: Low
**Priority**: MEDIUM (prevents future regressions)

#### Tasks

- [x] Create decision guide: .claude/docs/guides/skills-vs-subagents-decision.md:
  ```markdown
  # Skills vs Subagents vs Utilities Decision Guide

  ## When to Use Each Approach

  ### Use Utility Functions (bash scripts)
  - **Criteria**: Deterministic logic, no AI reasoning required
  - **Examples**: Topic numbering, directory creation, path sanitization
  - **Benefits**: Zero AI cost, 10-20x faster, testable
  - **Pattern**: Source library, call functions directly

  ### Use Subagents (Task tool)
  - **Criteria**: Orchestrated workflows, temporal dependencies, verification checkpoints
  - **Examples**: Research phases, planning, implementation
  - **Benefits**: Controlled execution order, checkpoint recovery, metadata extraction
  - **Pattern**: Task tool with behavioral injection

  ### Use Skills (automatic activation)
  - **Criteria**: Reusable expertise, standards enforcement, no timing dependencies
  - **Examples**: Code style checking, testing patterns, documentation standards
  - **Benefits**: 99% dormant token reduction, automatic activation
  - **Pattern**: Install skill, Claude activates when relevant

  ### Use Hybrid Approach
  - **Criteria**: Common simple cases + rare complex cases
  - **Examples**: Location detection (utilities 90%, agent 10%)
  - **Benefits**: Best of both worlds (efficiency + robustness)
  - **Pattern**: Heuristic determines method per invocation

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing (Phase 1)

**Scope**: Individual utility functions in topic-utils.sh

**Test Cases**:
1. `get_next_topic_number()`:
   - Empty directory → "001"
   - Directory with 005_topic → "006"
   - Directory with non-sequential (003, 007) → "008"
   - Directory with leading zeros handling (009 → 010)
2. `sanitize_topic_name()`:
   - Spaces → underscores
   - Uppercase → lowercase
   - Special characters removed
   - Length truncation (>50 chars)
   - Edge cases (empty string, all special chars)
3. `create_topic_structure()`:
   - All 6 subdirectories created
   - Handles existing directory
   - Error handling for failed mkdir

**Framework**: Custom bash test script with assertions

### Integration Testing (Phase 2)

**Scope**: Phase 0 refactor with downstream phase compatibility

**Test Cases**:
1. Location detection → Research phase data flow
2. Location detection → Planning phase data flow
3. Concurrent /supervise invocations (race conditions)
4. Error handling (invalid workflow descriptions, permission errors)

**Framework**: Full /supervise workflow execution with verification

### System Testing (Phase 4)

**Scope**: 50 diverse workflows across all use cases

**Test Categories**:
- Research workflows (10 tests)
- Feature workflows (10 tests)
- Refactor workflows (10 tests)
- Bug fix workflows (10 tests)
- Edge cases (10 tests)

**Validation**:
- Location accuracy: 100% correct
- Subdirectory creation: 100% complete
- Path format: 100% absolute
- Token usage: <11k average
- Execution time: <1s average

**Framework**: Automated test suite with pass/fail reporting

### Performance Testing (Phase 3)

**Scope**: Token usage and execution time benchmarks

**Metrics**:
- Token usage: Baseline (75.6k) vs Optimized (<11k)
- Execution time: Baseline (25.2s) vs Optimized (<1s)
- Cost: Baseline ($0.68) vs Optimized (<$0.04)

**Framework**: Monitoring dashboard with time series data

### Regression Testing (All Phases)

**Scope**: Ensure optimization doesn't break existing functionality

**Test Cases**:
- All existing /supervise workflows continue to work
- Downstream phases receive correct location context
- Workflow summaries reference correct paths
- Git commits include correct file paths

**Framework**: Compare results before and after optimization

## Dependencies

### Internal Dependencies

1. **detect-project-dir.sh** (already exists):
   - Used to determine PROJECT_ROOT
   - Path: .claude/lib/detect-project-dir.sh

2. **Model selection infrastructure** (from Report 074):
   - Task tool supports `model` parameter
   - Agent frontmatter supports `model: haiku-4.5`
   - Already implemented in Claude Code core

3. **Standards compliance** (.claude/docs/):
   - Directory Protocols for specs structure
   - Testing Protocols for test coverage requirements
   - Development Workflow for git commit standards

### External Dependencies

None - all changes are internal to .claude/ system

### Phase Dependencies

- Phase 1 → Phase 2 (utilities must exist before refactor)
- Phase 2 → Phase 4 (refactor must complete before comprehensive testing)
- Phase 4 → Phase 5 (testing validates before adding hybrid logic)
- Phase 4 → Phase 6 (validation required before system-wide rollout)

  ...
```

## Rollback Plan

### Trigger Conditions

Rollback to location-specialist agent if ANY of:
1. Location detection accuracy drops below 95%
2. Missing subdirectories detected in any workflow
3. Downstream phases fail due to path format issues
4. Concurrent invocation race conditions observed
5. Average token usage exceeds 15k tokens (vs <11k target)

### Rollback Procedure

**Step 1**: Revert supervise.md changes
```bash
cp .claude/commands/supervise.md.backup .claude/commands/supervise.md
```

**Step 2**: Keep Haiku 4.5 metadata in location-specialist.md
- Still provides 67% cost savings
- No quality issues with model switching (only utility function issues)

**Step 3**: Investigate root cause
- Review failed test cases
- Identify specific utility function bugs
- Determine if edge case or systematic issue

**Step 4**: Fix and retest
- Correct utility function implementation
- Rerun unit tests and integration tests
- Re-apply refactor only after 100% test pass rate

**Step 5**: Document lessons learned
- Add edge cases to test suite
- Update utility function documentation
- Refine heuristic logic (if using hybrid approach)

### Partial Rollback Options

**Option 1**: Hybrid approach (Phase 5)
- Keep utilities for 80-90% of simple cases
- Use agent for complex cases
- Maintains most optimization benefits

**Option 2**: Agent with Haiku 4.5 only (Phase 0)
- Revert to agent for all workflows
- Keep model: haiku-4.5 metadata
- Achieves 67% cost savings without utility risks

### Production Safeguards

1. **Feature flag**: Add environment variable to toggle utilities vs agent
   ```bash
   USE_LOCATION_UTILITIES="${USE_LOCATION_UTILITIES:-true}"
   ```
2. **Canary deployment**: Test with 10% of workflows before full rollout
3. **A/B comparison**: Run utilities and agent in parallel, compare results
4. **Automated alerting**: Monitor error rates, trigger rollback if exceeds threshold

## Notes

### Key Decisions

1. **Why utilities over agent for location detection?**
   - 90%+ of workflows are simple (project root + sequential topic number)
   - Topic number calculation is deterministic (ls → max → increment)
   - No AI reasoning required for straightforward logic
   - Existing /report and /plan commands prove pattern works

2. **Why Haiku 4.5 vs Skills?**
   - Skills lack temporal control (can't guarantee Phase 0 execution before Phase 1)
   - Skills require deterministic workflow orchestration (location detection is deterministic)
   - Haiku 4.5 preserves agent architecture with 67% cost savings
   - Skills better suited for standards enforcement (different use case)

3. **Why hybrid approach (Phase 5) is optional?**
   - Testing will reveal if edge cases actually require agent
   - May be premature optimization if 98%+ workflows work with utilities
   - Can be added later if production data shows need

### Future Enhancements

1. **Concurrent invocation handling**:
   - Add file locking for topic number calculation
   - Prevents race conditions in parallel /orchestrate workflows
   - Low priority (rare use case)

2. **Machine learning heuristic**:
   - Train model on historical workflows (complex vs simple)
   - Refine complexity detection beyond regex patterns
   - Requires sufficient training data (>500 workflows)

3. **Intelligent topic merging**:
   - Detect similar existing topics before creating new one
   - Suggest reusing existing topic directory
   - Reduces specs/ directory bloat

4. **System-wide model selection** (Report 074):
   - Apply Haiku/Sonnet/Opus assignment to all 19 agents
   - 20% overall cost reduction across all commands
   - 25-35% time savings system-wide

### Research References

This plan draws on three comprehensive research reports:

1. **Model Switching Mechanisms** (001, 845 lines):
   - Haiku 4.5 specifications and cost-benefit analysis
   - Model selection infrastructure already in Claude Code
   - Agent-to-model assignment recommendations

2. **Skills Architecture** (002, 375 lines):
   - Skills vs subagents architectural analysis
   - Why skills are unsuitable for location detection
   - When to use skills (standards enforcement, not orchestration)

3. **Optimization Patterns** (003, 484 lines):
   - Current location-specialist inefficiencies (15-20k tokens wasted)
   - Utility function patterns from /report and /plan
   - Heuristic-based detection strategies

All research findings synthesized in [Research Overview](../reports/002_research/OVERVIEW.md) (627 lines).

## Revision History

### 2025-10-23 - Revision 1: .claude/docs/ Compliance Update

**Changes**: Updated plan structure to comply with .claude/docs/ standards

**Reason**: Ensure plan follows directory protocols, progressive organization standards, and imperative language guidelines

**Modified Sections**:
- **Metadata**: Added "Organization Level: Level 0" declaration per progressive organization standards
- **All Phases (0-7)**: Added structured phase metadata in compliance with directory-protocols.md:
  - `Dependencies: []` or `[phase_numbers]` for wave-based execution support
  - `Estimated Time:` (renamed from Duration for consistency)
  - `Risk:` (Low/Medium/High per phase)
- **Language**: Replaced weak language with imperative verbs per imperative-language-guide.md:
  - "should be validated" → "MUST be validated"
  - "should be implemented" → "MUST be implemented"
  - "Can be scheduled" → "SHALL be scheduled"
- **Temporal Markers**: Removed temporal language per writing-standards.md:
  - "New Component" → "Component"

  - "modernize testing" → "refactor testing"

**Standards Compliance Achieved**:
- ✅ Level 0 organization declared (all phases inline, single file)
- ✅ Phase dependencies structured for wave-based parallel execution
- ✅ Risk assessment per phase
- ✅ Estimated time formatted consistently
- ✅ Imperative language ratio improved (0 → minimal weak language)
- ✅ Temporal markers removed (7 → 0)
- ✅ Backup created: `002_optimize_supervise_location_detection.md.backup-20251023-135417`

### 2025-10-23 - Revision 2: /supervise Recent Changes Alignment

**Trigger**: Research identified significant /supervise enhancements implemented on Oct 23, 2025 (same day as plan creation) that affect baseline assumptions.

**Research Findings**:
1. **Auto-recovery infrastructure ALREADY IMPLEMENTED** (Phase 0-5 enhancements):
   - Error handling library integration (.claude/lib/error-handling.sh)
   - Single-retry strategy for transient failures
   - Partial success handling (≥50% research agents threshold)
   - Checkpoint integration (.claude/lib/checkpoint-utils.sh)
   - Enhanced error reporting with recovery suggestions

2. **Existing Utilities Discovered**:
   - ✅ `.claude/lib/detect-project-dir.sh` exists (project root detection)
   - ❌ `.claude/lib/topic-utils.sh` does NOT exist (topic management functions proposed in Phase 1 still needed)

3. **Standards Compliance Gap Identified**:
   - Verification and Fallback pattern (.claude/docs/concepts/patterns/verification-fallback.md) requires MANDATORY VERIFICATION checkpoints
   - Current Phase 0 verifies directory creation but NOT location context from agent
   - Missing fallback mechanism if location-specialist agent fails

**Plan Updates**:

1. **Added "Recent Changes to /supervise" Section** (after Metadata):
   - Documents Oct 23, 2025 auto-recovery enhancements
   - Clarifies existing vs missing utilities
   - Confirms core optimization (agent → utilities) remains unaddressed
   - Baseline correction: Recent enhancements improve reliability, NOT performance

2. **Updated Overview Section**:
   - Added specific line numbers for Phase 0 in supervise.md (772-966)
   - Identified location-specialist agent STEP 1 as expensive (Grep/Glob searches, 15-20k tokens)
   - Added standards compliance requirement (Verification and Fallback pattern)

3. **Enhanced Success Criteria**:
   - Added: MANDATORY VERIFICATION checkpoint (standards compliance)
   - Added: Fallback mechanism implementation
   - Added: Reliability ≥100% (match or exceed agent baseline)

4. **Phase 1 Update**:
   - Added note acknowledging detect-project-dir.sh already exists
   - Clarified Phase 1 creates NEW topic-utils.sh and integrates with existing utilities

5. **Phase 2 Update** (already expanded to phase_2_refactor_supervise_utilities.md):
   - Changed objective to include "AND add MANDATORY VERIFICATION checkpoint"
   - Noted expanded specification includes verification checkpoints and fallback mechanisms

6. **Phase 5 Priority Change**:
   - Changed from "Optional" to "RECOMMENDED"
   - Elevated priority from MEDIUM to HIGH
   - Added justification section explaining why hybrid is recommended:
     - Recent auto-recovery enhancements show robustness is critical
     - 90% utilities + 10% agent fallback = 100% reliability
     - Graceful degradation for edge cases
     - Zero user intervention required

**Standards Compliance Improvements**:
- ✅ Aligned with Verification and Fallback pattern requirements
- ✅ Acknowledged existing infrastructure (detect-project-dir.sh, error-handling.sh)
- ✅ Added verification checkpoint requirements to Phase 2
- ✅ Strengthened hybrid approach recommendation based on reliability requirements

**Implementation Impact**:
- Phases 0-6 remain structurally unchanged
- Phase 1 acknowledges existing utility (no redundant work)
- Phase 2 expanded specification (1,971 lines) already includes verification requirements
- Phase 5 elevated to recommended (not optional) based on robustness requirements
- No redundant phases (auto-recovery already complete)
