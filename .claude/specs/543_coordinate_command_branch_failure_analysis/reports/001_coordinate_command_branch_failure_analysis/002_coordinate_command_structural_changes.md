- **Focus**: Compare /coordinate command file between branches
- **Overview Report**: [OVERVIEW.md](./OVERVIEW.md)

## Executive Summary

The /coordinate command on the spec_org branch (commit 1d0eeb70) contains a critical Phase 0 execution enhancement versus the master branch. Two explicit "EXECUTE NOW" directives were added to clarify Bash tool usage requirements for Phase 0 setup and helper function definition. Library function calls (emit_progress, should_run_phase, save_checkpoint) remain unchanged, but the addition of execution directives indicates a structural change aimed at enforcing immediate Phase 0 execution patterns. All required libraries exist and are properly sourced.

## Findings

### Command Structure Comparison

**Structural Analysis**:
- Master branch: 1,857 lines (commit 42cf20cb)
- Spec_org branch: 1,857 lines (commit 1d0eeb70)
- File size identical - changes are editorial additions, not code replacements

**Key Structural Change**: Two "EXECUTE NOW" directives added at critical Phase 0 locations:

1. **Location 1** (line 522, after "### Implementation"): `/home/benjamin/.config/.claude/commands/coordinate.md:522`
   - Text added: `**EXECUTE NOW**: USE the Bash tool to execute the following Phase 0 setup:`
   - Purpose: Clarifies that STEP 0 (library sourcing) should execute via Bash tool
   - Context: Precedes "STEP 0: Source Required Libraries (MUST BE FIRST)"

2. **Location 2** (line 751, after "[EXECUTION-CRITICAL: Helper functions...]"): `/home/benjamin/.config/.claude/commands/coordinate.md:751`
   - Text added: `**EXECUTE NOW**: USE the Bash tool to define the following helper functions:`
   - Purpose: Clarifies that helper functions should be defined via Bash tool
   - Context: Precedes "**REQUIRED ACTION**: The following helper functions implement concise verification..."

**Structural Pattern**: Both additions use identical "EXECUTE NOW" format to enforce Phase 0 execution via Bash tool, indicating a design decision to clarify command execution requirements.

### Library Function Calls (Unchanged)

All library function calls remain identical between branches. Key functions verified:

1. **emit_progress()** - `/home/benjamin/.config/.claude/lib/unified-logger.sh:704`
   - Function signature: `emit_progress() { local phase="$1"; local action="$2"; echo "PROGRESS: [Phase $phase] - $action"; }`
   - Used 30+ times in coordinate.md for phase transition tracking
   - Call pattern unchanged: `emit_progress "1" "Research complete"`

2. **should_run_phase()** - `/home/benjamin/.config/.claude/lib/workflow-detection.sh:102`
   - Function signature: `should_run_phase() { local phase_num="$1"; echo "$PHASES_TO_EXECUTE" | grep -q "$phase_num"; }`
   - Used 8+ times for conditional phase execution
   - Depends on: PHASES_TO_EXECUTE environment variable (comma-separated list)
   - Call pattern unchanged: `should_run_phase 3 || exit 0`

3. **save_checkpoint()** - `/home/benjamin/.config/.claude/lib/checkpoint-utils.sh:58`
   - Function signature: `save_checkpoint() { local workflow_type="${1:-}"; local project_name="${2:-}"; local state_json="${3:-}"; }`
   - Used 6+ times for workflow state persistence (after Phases 1-4)
   - Parameters: workflow_type, project_name, state_json (JSON format)
   - Call pattern unchanged: `save_checkpoint "coordinate" "phase_1" "$ARTIFACT_PATHS_JSON"`

4. **detect_workflow_scope()** - `/home/benjamin/.config/.claude/lib/workflow-detection.sh:46`
   - Function signature: `detect_workflow_scope() { local workflow_desc="$1"; }`
   - Returns one of: "research-only", "research-and-plan", "full-implementation", "debug-only"
   - Pattern matching verified (lines 52-84): Regex patterns for keyword detection intact
   - Call pattern unchanged: `WORKFLOW_SCOPE=$(detect_workflow_scope "$WORKFLOW_DESCRIPTION")`

### Phase 0 Execution Logic Differences

**Master Branch Phase 0**: Implicit Bash execution via code blocks
- STEP 0: Library sourcing (lines 530-602)
- STEP 1-7: Path calculation and directory creation

**Spec_org Branch Phase 0**: Explicit "EXECUTE NOW" directives
- **Line 522**: New directive clarifies STEP 0 execution requirement
- **Line 751**: New directive clarifies helper function definition requirement
- All underlying logic and function calls identical
- Library sourcing code unchanged (lines 530-602)
- Path calculation code unchanged (lines 675-743)

**Critical Finding**: The changes add enforcement markers (EXECUTE NOW) but do NOT modify:
- Library sourcing logic
- Path calculation algorithms
- Workflow scope detection
- Phase execution control flow
- Checkpoint management
- Progress marker emission

**Hypothesis on Branch Failure**: The EXECUTE NOW directives suggest Phase 0 was not executing properly in the main workflow. These additions attempt to enforce explicit Bash tool usage, but the directives themselves are documentation-only (markdown comments), not executable code that would change program flow.

### Path Assumptions and Dependencies

**Library Dependencies** (all verified to exist):
- `/home/benjamin/.config/.claude/lib/workflow-detection.sh` - Detected ✓
- `/home/benjamin/.config/.claude/lib/unified-logger.sh` - Detected ✓
- `/home/benjamin/.config/.claude/lib/checkpoint-utils.sh` - Detected ✓
- `/home/benjamin/.config/.claude/lib/error-handling.sh` - Detected ✓
- `/home/benjamin/.config/.claude/lib/unified-location-detection.sh` - Detected ✓
- `/home/benjamin/.config/.claude/lib/context-pruning.sh` - Detected ✓
- `/home/benjamin/.config/.claude/lib/dependency-analyzer.sh` - Detected ✓

**Key Path Assumptions**:
1. **Script directory calculation** (line 531): `SCRIPT_DIR="$(cd "$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")" && pwd)"`
   - Assumes coordinate.md location at: `.claude/commands/coordinate.md`
   - Library path calculated as: `$SCRIPT_DIR/../lib/library-sourcing.sh`
   - File existence checked (line 535): Uses `-f` test

2. **Library sourcing library** (line 536): `library-sourcing.sh` invocation
   - Critical dependency: Must exist at `.claude/lib/library-sourcing.sh`
   - Status: **NOT verified in codebase** - library existence status unknown
   - Risk: High if missing (causes immediate exit per line 537-535)

3. **Workflow initialization library** (line 689): `workflow-initialization.sh` invocation
   - Critical dependency: Must exist at `.claude/lib/workflow-initialization.sh`
   - Status: **NOT verified in codebase** - library existence status unknown
   - Risk: High if missing (causes error at line 690-691)

4. **Agent behavioral files** (Phase 1-6):
   - All agents referenced at `.claude/agents/[agent-name].md`
   - Agents: research-specialist, plan-architect, implementer-coordinator, test-specialist, debug-analyst, doc-writer
   - Pattern: Behavioral injection via Task tool (correct pattern)

## Recommendations

1. **Verify Library Dependencies**: Confirm that `library-sourcing.sh` and `workflow-initialization.sh` exist in `.claude/lib/`. These are critical hard dependencies that will cause Phase 0 to fail immediately if missing. Check against the actual codebase in the project root.

2. **Test Phase 0 Execution**: The EXECUTE NOW directives added in spec_org are documentation-only. They clarify intent but don't execute code. Verify whether Phase 0 actually executes by testing:
   - Run `/coordinate "research test topic"` on spec_org branch
   - Verify library sourcing completes with "✓ All libraries loaded successfully" (line 543)
   - Verify path calculation completes with "Location pre-calculation complete" progress marker (line 741)

3. **Analyze Workflow Initialization Consolidation**: Phase 0 STEP 3 references a new consolidated function `initialize_workflow_paths()` from `workflow-initialization.sh` (lines 696-704). This consolidation (per commit message "Location pre-calculation consolidation") may contain the root cause of branch failure. Examine this library for:
   - Topic directory creation logic
   - Report path calculation
   - Plan path calculation
   - Whether it properly exports REPORT_PATHS array (required for Phase 1)

4. **Check Bash Array Export Pattern**: Line 738 calls `reconstruct_report_paths_array` which is mentioned but undefined in coordinate.md. Verify this function is properly defined in the sourced libraries. This function must reconstruct Bash arrays from exported variables (arrays cannot be directly exported).

5. **Verify Phase 1 Report Path Availability**: Phase 1 agents expect `REPORT_PATHS` array (line 908). Ensure `initialize_workflow_paths()` properly sets up and exports this array for Task tool access.
