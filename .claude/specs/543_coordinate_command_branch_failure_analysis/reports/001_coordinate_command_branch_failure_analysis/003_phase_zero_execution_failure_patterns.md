## Executive Summary

Phase 0 execution failures stem from a fundamental architectural pattern where bash code blocks must be preceded by explicit "EXECUTE NOW" directives for Claude to treat them as executable rather than documentation. The /coordinate command's Phase 0 was completely non-functional until commit 1d0eeb70 added missing execution directives, demonstrating a critical category of failure mode affecting all orchestration commands using unified-location-detection.sh library pattern.

## Findings

### 1. Root Cause: Missing Execution Directive Pattern

**Problem**: Phase 0 bash blocks in `/coordinate` lacked explicit "EXECUTE NOW" directives before code fences.

**Evidence** (coordinate.md, line 520-524):
```markdown
### Implementation

STEP 0: Source Required Libraries (MUST BE FIRST)

\`\`\`bash
# Code block here without EXECUTE NOW directive
\`\`\`
```

**Fix Applied** (commit 1d0eeb70):
```markdown
### Implementation

**EXECUTE NOW**: USE the Bash tool to execute the following Phase 0 setup:

STEP 0: Source Required Libraries (MUST BE FIRST)

\`\`\`bash
# Code block now executes because of directive above
\`\`\`
```

**Impact**: Before fix, Claude treated Phase 0 bash blocks as documentation/examples, never sourcing libraries or pre-calculating paths. After fix, all Phase 0 operations execute properly.

### 2. Asymmetric Directive Pattern in /coordinate

**Analysis**: Phase 1-7 used consistent "EXECUTE NOW" directives while Phase 0 did not.

**Evidence** (coordinate.md):
- **Phase 1** (line ~869): `**EXECUTE NOW**: USE the Task tool for each research topic...` ✓
- **Phase 2** (line ~1069): `**EXECUTE NOW**: USE the Task tool with these parameters...` ✓
- **Phase 3** (line ~1253): `**EXECUTE NOW**: USE the Task tool with these parameters...` ✓
- **Phase 4** (line ~1387): `**EXECUTE NOW**: USE the Task tool with these parameters...` ✓
- **Phase 5-7**: Similar pattern with explicit directives ✓
- **Phase 0**: No directives before library sourcing bash blocks ✗
- **Helper Functions** (line 751): No directive before function definitions ✗

**Conclusion**: The command had complete coverage of execution directives for agent invocations (Phases 1-7) but critical gap for bash library sourcing (Phase 0), creating asymmetric execution behavior.

### 3. Phase 0 Optimization Architecture

**Purpose**: Calculate artifact paths before any agent invocation to reduce token usage by 85% (75,600 → 11,000 tokens) and improve speed by 25x.

**Three-Step Pattern**:
1. **Library Sourcing** (library-sourcing.sh)
   - Lines 524-543: Source all required libraries
   - Verify critical functions defined (detect_workflow_scope, should_run_phase, emit_progress, etc.)

2. **Scope Detection** (workflow-detection.sh)
   - Lines 646-671: Detect workflow type from description
   - Map to phase execution list (research-only, research-and-plan, full-implementation, debug-only)
   - Export WORKFLOW_SCOPE, PHASES_TO_EXECUTE, SKIP_PHASES

3. **Path Pre-Calculation** (workflow-initialization.sh)
   - Lines 676-743: Initialize topic directory and calculate all artifact paths
   - Lazy directory creation (only topic dir, artifact dirs created on-demand)
   - Export TOPIC_PATH, REPORTS_DIR, PLANS_DIR, SUMMARIES_DIR, DEBUG_DIR

**Critical Dependencies**: Each step depends on previous step's success:
- Step 1 requires library files to exist and be syntactically correct
- Step 2 requires detect_workflow_scope() function from Step 1
- Step 3 requires workflow initialization after scope detection

### 4. Silent Failure Mechanisms

**Without EXECUTE NOW Directive**:
- Claude reads Phase 0 section as documentation
- Recognizes bash code blocks but treats them as examples
- Never invokes Bash tool
- No error messages (silent failure)
- Phase 1-7 execute with uninitialized environment variables
- Workflow_scope, topic_path, report paths all undefined

**Result**: All subsequent agent invocations failed because:
- WORKFLOW_SCOPE undefined → can't determine phases to execute
- TOPIC_PATH undefined → artifact paths point to wrong location
- Libraries never sourced → utility functions unavailable
- Environment variables not exported → Task tool receives empty context

### 5. Verification Checkpoint Implementation

**Helper Functions** (lines 751+): Define verify_file_created() and related functions
- Takes 3 parameters: file_path, item_description, phase_name
- Returns 0 on success (prints "✓"), 1 on failure (prints diagnostic)
- Used throughout phases 1-7 to verify agent outputs

**Pattern Issue**: Helper functions also lacked EXECUTE NOW directive in original code
- Functions defined inline in markdown
- No execution directive meant function definitions never loaded
- Any subsequent call to verify_file_created() would fail with "command not found"

**Fix**: Added second EXECUTE NOW directive at line 751
- "**EXECUTE NOW**: USE the Bash tool to define the following helper functions:"
- Functions now defined and available for use in phase-specific bash blocks

### 6. Comparison with Other Commands

**phase-0-optimization.md Requirements**:
All commands implementing unified library pattern should follow:
```markdown
## Phase 0: Location Detection

**EXECUTE NOW**: USE the Bash tool to perform location detection:

\`\`\`bash
source "${CLAUDE_CONFIG}/.claude/lib/unified-location-detection.sh"
LOCATION_JSON=$(perform_location_detection "$WORKFLOW_DESCRIPTION")
...
\`\`\`
```

**Commands Analyzed**:
- `/orchestrate.md` - Has execution directives ✓
- `/supervise.md` - Has execution directives ✓
- `/coordinate.md` - Missing until commit 1d0eeb70 ✗ (now fixed)
- `/implement.md` - Has execution directives ✓
- `/research.md` - Has execution directives ✓

### 7. Token Impact Analysis

**Before Fix (Phase 0 never executed)**:
```
Phase 0: 0 tokens (didn't execute)
Phase 1: X tokens for research
Phase 2: Y tokens for planning
Problem: Wrong paths → agents create files in wrong locations → workflow fails
```

**After Fix (Phase 0 properly executes)**:
```
Phase 0: 11,000 tokens (library sourcing + path pre-calculation)
Phase 1-7: Reduced tokens because paths pre-calculated
Total: 85% reduction vs agent-based detection pattern
```

**Trade-off**: Phase 0 uses 11,000 tokens but saves 64,600 tokens by eliminating agent-based detection, net savings of 53,600 tokens (214% reduction from original agent pattern).

### 8. Failure Pattern Categories

**Category 1: Execution Directive Missing** (Confirmed in /coordinate Phase 0 before fix)
- Code blocks present but no "EXECUTE NOW" directive
- Claude treats as documentation
- No error message (silent failure)
- Subsequent phases fail due to undefined environment

**Category 2: Library Loading Failure** (Catch by fail-fast checkpoint)
- Library file missing or corrupted
- fail-fast error checking at lines 531-536
- Explicit error message with diagnostic path
- Prevents silent cascading failures

**Category 3: Function Definition Missing** (Catch by function verification checkpoint)
- Library sourced but function not defined
- Verification loop at lines 545-567 checks all required functions
- MISSING_FUNCTIONS array populated with names of undefined functions
- Clear error report with list of missing functions

**Category 4: Directory Creation Failure** (Catch by directory verification checkpoint)
- perform_location_detection() called but topic directory not created
- Verification at line 230 (phase-0-optimization.md)
- Diagnostic output includes parent directory status
- Suggests `mkdir -p` command if directory doesn't exist

### 9. Lazy Directory Creation Pattern

**Original Problem**: Agent-based detection created all directories eagerly
- Spec 082 created: 082_topic/, reports/, plans/, summaries/, debug/, scripts/, outputs/
- If research failed, all empty dirs remained
- Repository accumulated 400-500 empty directories
- Git status slow, navigation confusing

**Solution**: Library-based Phase 0 creates only topic directory
- Line 129 in phase-0-optimization.md: `mkdir -p specs/082_topic/  # Topic directory only`
- Artifact directories created on-demand (lazy creation)
- Lines 693-699 in coordinate.md: Call initialize_workflow_paths() which creates only topic dir
- Agents create artifact-specific dirs when writing files

**Benefit**: Failed workflows leave no pollution, directory existence indicates actual artifacts present.

### 10. Checkpoint Recovery Integration

**Phase 0 Output** (lines 736-743):
```bash
# Reconstruct REPORT_PATHS array from exported variables
reconstruct_report_paths_array

# Emit progress marker
emit_progress "0" "Location pre-calculation complete (topic: $TOPIC_PATH)"
```

**Checkpoint Saved**: After Phase 0 completes, context saved for potential resume
- Current phase marked as 0
- All paths exported for Phase 1-7 access
- If workflow interrupted, can resume from Phase 1
- Prevents re-running expensive location detection

## Recommendations

### 1. Mandatory Phase 0 Execution Directive Validation

**Action**: Add pre-flight check in all orchestration commands to verify Phase 0 directives present
**Implementation**:
```bash
if ! grep -q "**EXECUTE NOW.*Phase 0\|**EXECUTE NOW.*Bash tool.*Phase 0" /path/to/command.md; then
  echo "ERROR: Phase 0 EXECUTE NOW directive missing"
  echo "FIX: Add '**EXECUTE NOW**: USE the Bash tool to...' before Phase 0 bash blocks"
fi
```
**Benefit**: Catch missing directives before command execution

### 2. Phase 0 Documentation Template

**Action**: Create standardized template for all commands implementing unified library pattern
**Template** (from phase-0-optimization.md lines 170-266):
- Library sourcing with fail-fast error handling
- JSON parsing with jq/sed fallback
- Mandatory verification checkpoint
- Clear completion signal (LOCATION_COMPLETE)

**Benefit**: Ensures consistency across all orchestration commands, prevents directive omissions

### 3. Silent Failure Detection

**Action**: Add logging to detect when Phase 0 bash blocks aren't executing
**Implementation**: Log each major Phase 0 step:
```bash
emit_progress "0.1" "Starting library sourcing"
emit_progress "0.2" "Scope detection in progress"
emit_progress "0.3" "Path pre-calculation complete"
```
**Benefit**: Progress markers make silent failures obvious in logs

### 4. Helper Function Placement Documentation

**Action**: Document that inline function definitions also require EXECUTE NOW directives
**Guidance**: Any bash code block (whether sourcing, function definition, or variable initialization) needs "EXECUTE NOW" before markdown code fence
**Affected Areas**: Verification helpers (lines 751+), phase-specific helpers in all commands

### 5. Asymmetry Audit for All Commands

**Action**: Audit all orchestration commands to ensure Phase 0 has same directive pattern as Phase 1-7
**Commands to Check**:
- /orchestrate (verify complete coverage)
- /supervise (verify complete coverage)
- /coordinate (FIXED in commit 1d0eeb70)
- /implement (verify complete coverage)
- /research (verify complete coverage)

**Checklist**:
- [ ] Phase 0 library sourcing has "EXECUTE NOW" directive
- [ ] Phase 0 helper functions have "EXECUTE NOW" directive
- [ ] All Phase 0 bash blocks within execution context
- [ ] Phase 1-7 have consistent directive pattern

### 6. Error Message Enhancement

**Action**: Add specific diagnostic for Phase 0 execution failures
**Enhancement**: When WORKFLOW_SCOPE undefined (indicating Phase 0 didn't run):
```bash
if [ -z "$WORKFLOW_SCOPE" ]; then
  echo "ERROR: Phase 0 execution failed or was skipped"
  echo "DIAGNOSIS: WORKFLOW_SCOPE environment variable is undefined"
  echo "REASON: Phase 0 bash blocks not executed (missing EXECUTE NOW directive?)"
  echo "ACTION: Verify '**EXECUTE NOW**: USE the Bash tool' precedes Phase 0 code"
  exit 1
fi
```
**Benefit**: Converts silent failures to explicit errors with guidance
