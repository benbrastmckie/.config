# Implementation Plan: Migrate to Unified Library Architecture

## Metadata

- **Plan ID**: 001
- **Created**: 2025-10-30
- **Status**: ✅ IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE
- **Completed**: 2025-10-30
- **Structure Level**: 0 (single-file plan)
- **Estimated Duration**: 2-3 hours
- **Actual Duration**: ~45 minutes
- **Complexity**: 6/10
- **Risk Level**: Low-Medium
- **Research Reports**:
  - `.claude/specs/543_coordinate_command_branch_failure_analysis/reports/001_coordinate_command_branch_failure_analysis/OVERVIEW.md`
  - `.claude/specs/528_create_a_detailed_implementation_plan_to_remove_al/plans/003_unified_compatibility_removal_plan.md`

## Standards Compliance

- **Development Philosophy**: Clean-break migration to new architecture, no shims or compatibility layers
- **Error Handling**: Fail-fast with immediate bash errors for missing libraries
- **Testing Protocol**: Maintain baseline (60/69 = 87%), fix any new failures
- **Commit Strategy**: Single atomic commit for all library migrations
- **Rollback Strategy**: Git revert only (no archive files)

## Overview

### Objective

Migrate all commands from the deleted `artifact-operations.sh` to the new unified library architecture by updating source statements to use `artifact-creation.sh` and `artifact-registry.sh` directly. This plan implements a **zero-shim migration** that preserves the architectural improvements from spec_org branch while fixing the /coordinate command failures.

### Problem Analysis

Based on research reports, the root causes are:

1. **Library Deletion** (Primary Blocker): `artifact-operations.sh` deleted without migration, breaking 77 commands
2. **Phase 0 Directives** (Secondary Issue): Fixed in commit 1d0eeb70 ✓

The new architecture splits artifact-operations.sh into two focused modules:
- `artifact-creation.sh` (267 lines): Artifact file creation, directory management, path calculation
- `artifact-registry.sh` (410 lines): Artifact tracking, querying, validation

### Migration Strategy

**NO SHIMS APPROACH**: Instead of restoring artifact-operations.sh as a compatibility shim, we will:
1. Update all `source .claude/lib/artifact-operations.sh` statements to source both new libraries
2. Verify all function calls are compatible (research shows functions unchanged)
3. Leverage existing `library-sourcing.sh` infrastructure for consolidated sourcing
4. Test incrementally to ensure no regressions

### Philosophy

This implementation follows the project's clean-break approach:
- **No compatibility layers**: Direct migration to new library pattern
- **No transition period**: All changes in one commit
- **Fail-fast errors**: Missing libraries produce immediate bash errors
- **Git history only**: No shims, no archives, no deprecated code
- **Production ready**: Tests pass, documentation current, new architecture adopted

## Success Criteria

- [x] All 48 files updated to source new libraries (artifact-creation.sh + artifact-registry.sh)
- [x] Zero references to artifact-operations.sh in active code
- [x] Test baseline maintained (60/69 passing minimum, aim for improvements) - **EXCEEDED: 69/69 (100%)**
- [x] /coordinate command executes successfully on spec_org branch
- [x] All orchestration commands (/orchestrate, /implement, /research, /plan) functional
- [x] Documentation reflects new library architecture only
- [x] Single atomic git commit with all changes (commit: af8c3aca)
- [x] No backward compatibility code or shims added

## Technical Design

### New Library Architecture

The spec_org branch implements a **split-library pattern**:

```
Old Pattern (master branch):
  artifact-operations.sh (56 lines)
    ├─ Thin shim sourcing two libraries
    └─ No function exports

New Pattern (spec_org branch):
  artifact-creation.sh (267 lines)
    ├─ create_topic_artifact()
    ├─ get_next_artifact_number()
    ├─ write_artifact_file()
    ├─ generate_artifact_invocation()
    └─ create_artifact_directory_with_workflow()

  artifact-registry.sh (410 lines)
    ├─ register_artifact()
    ├─ query_artifacts()
    ├─ get_artifact_path()
    ├─ validate_operation_artifacts()
    └─ register_operation_artifact()
```

### Function Mapping

**All functions remain unchanged** - only the source file changes:

| Function | Old Location | New Location |
|----------|--------------|--------------|
| `create_topic_artifact()` | artifact-operations.sh | artifact-creation.sh |
| `get_next_artifact_number()` | artifact-operations.sh | artifact-creation.sh |
| `write_artifact_file()` | artifact-operations.sh | artifact-creation.sh |
| `generate_artifact_invocation()` | artifact-operations.sh | artifact-creation.sh |
| `register_artifact()` | artifact-operations.sh | artifact-registry.sh |
| `query_artifacts()` | artifact-operations.sh | artifact-registry.sh |
| `get_artifact_path()` | artifact-operations.sh | artifact-registry.sh |
| `validate_operation_artifacts()` | artifact-operations.sh | artifact-registry.sh |
| `register_operation_artifact()` | artifact-operations.sh | artifact-registry.sh |

**Migration Impact**: Zero function signature changes, only source statements need updates.

### Migration Pattern

**Pattern 1: Direct Sourcing (Commands)**

```bash
# OLD (master branch):
source .claude/lib/artifact-operations.sh

# NEW (spec_org branch):
source .claude/lib/artifact-creation.sh
source .claude/lib/artifact-registry.sh
```

**Pattern 2: Consolidated Sourcing (Orchestration Commands)**

For commands using `library-sourcing.sh`, leverage the new infrastructure:

```bash
# OLD:
source .claude/lib/artifact-operations.sh
source .claude/lib/error-handling.sh
source .claude/lib/checkpoint-utils.sh
# ... 5 more libraries

# NEW (consolidated):
source .claude/lib/library-sourcing.sh
source_required_libraries || exit 1
```

**Benefits**:
- Automatic deduplication of library sources
- Consistent error handling across commands
- Single point of library loading logic
- Easier maintenance and updates

**Pattern 3: Library Internal References**

Some libraries internally source artifact-operations.sh (e.g., `auto-analysis-utils.sh`):

```bash
# OLD (in library files):
source "${SCRIPT_DIR}/artifact-operations.sh"

# NEW:
source "${SCRIPT_DIR}/artifact-creation.sh"
source "${SCRIPT_DIR}/artifact-registry.sh"
```

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Update Command Files (27 files) [COMPLETED]

**Objective**: Migrate all slash commands to source new libraries instead of artifact-operations.sh

**Complexity**: Low - Simple find-and-replace pattern

**Status**: ✅ Completed - Commands were already migrated in previous work

**Files to Update** (27 commands):
- `.claude/commands/orchestrate.md`
- `.claude/commands/coordinate.md` ⚠️ PRIORITY (blocks all workflows)
- `.claude/commands/implement.md`
- `.claude/commands/research.md`
- `.claude/commands/plan.md`
- `.claude/commands/debug.md`
- `.claude/commands/list.md`
- `.claude/commands/update_plan.md`
- `.claude/commands/list_summaries.md`
- `.claude/commands/list_plans.md`
- Plus ~17 other commands sourcing artifact-operations.sh

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Find all command files sourcing artifact-operations.sh
  ```bash
  grep -l "source.*artifact-operations\.sh" .claude/commands/*.md
  ```
- [ ] For each command, replace source statement with:
  ```bash
  source .claude/lib/artifact-creation.sh
  source .claude/lib/artifact-registry.sh
  ```
- [ ] Verify no artifact-operations.sh references remain in commands:
  ```bash
  grep -r "artifact-operations" .claude/commands/ || echo "✓ Commands clean"
  ```
- [ ] Run quick smoke test on /coordinate command:
  ```bash
  # Test that command loads without errors
  # This doesn't execute full workflow, just validates library loading
  ```

**Testing**:
```bash
# Verify libraries load successfully
cd /home/benjamin/.config
source .claude/lib/artifact-creation.sh || echo "FAIL: artifact-creation.sh"
source .claude/lib/artifact-registry.sh || echo "FAIL: artifact-registry.sh"

# Verify key functions exported
declare -f create_topic_artifact > /dev/null || echo "FAIL: create_topic_artifact not exported"
declare -f register_artifact > /dev/null || echo "FAIL: register_artifact not exported"
```

**Expected Outcome**: All 27 commands load new libraries successfully, no artifact-operations.sh references in commands.

---

### Phase 2: Update Agent Files (6 files) [COMPLETED]

**Objective**: Migrate agent behavioral files to source new libraries

**Complexity**: Low - Same find-and-replace pattern

**Status**: ✅ Completed - Agents were already migrated in previous work

**Files to Update** (6 agents):
- `.claude/agents/spec-updater.md`
- `.claude/agents/implementation-researcher.md`
- Plus ~4 other agents

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Find all agent files sourcing artifact-operations.sh:
  ```bash
  grep -l "source.*artifact-operations\.sh" .claude/agents/*.md
  ```
- [ ] For each agent, replace source statement with new libraries
- [ ] Verify no artifact-operations.sh references remain in agents:
  ```bash
  grep -r "artifact-operations" .claude/agents/ || echo "✓ Agents clean"
  ```

**Testing**:
```bash
# Verify agents can be invoked without errors
# Check sample agent prompt loads libraries correctly
```

**Expected Outcome**: All 6 agents updated, zero artifact-operations.sh references.

---

### Phase 3: Update Library Files (5 files) [COMPLETED]

**Objective**: Migrate library internal references to source new libraries

**Complexity**: Low - Same pattern, but verify no circular dependencies

**Status**: ✅ Completed - Libraries were already migrated in previous work

**Files to Update** (5 libraries):
- `.claude/lib/auto-analysis-utils.sh` (sources artifact-registry.sh internally)
- Plus ~4 other libraries with internal references

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Find all libraries internally sourcing artifact-operations.sh:
  ```bash
  grep -l "source.*artifact-operations\.sh" .claude/lib/*.sh | grep -v "artifact-creation\|artifact-registry"
  ```
- [ ] For each library, replace source statement:
  ```bash
  source "${SCRIPT_DIR}/artifact-creation.sh"
  source "${SCRIPT_DIR}/artifact-registry.sh"
  ```
- [ ] Verify no circular dependencies created:
  ```bash
  # artifact-creation.sh sources artifact-registry.sh (line 10)
  # artifact-registry.sh sources no artifact files
  # Other libraries should source both safely
  ```
- [ ] Check library-sourcing.sh doesn't need updates (it doesn't source artifact-operations.sh)

**Testing**:
```bash
# Source all libraries and verify no errors
for lib in .claude/lib/*.sh; do
  source "$lib" 2>&1 || echo "FAIL: $lib"
done
```

**Expected Outcome**: All 5 libraries updated, no circular dependencies, all libraries sourceable.

---

### Phase 4: Update Test Files (Multiple files) [COMPLETED]

**Objective**: Migrate test suite to use new libraries

**Complexity**: Medium - Tests may have hardcoded paths or mock expectations

**Status**: ✅ Completed - Updated 5 test files, all 69/69 tests passing

**Files to Update** (multiple test scripts):
- `test_command_integration.sh`
- `test_state_management.sh`
- Plus other tests referencing artifact-operations.sh

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Find all test files sourcing artifact-operations.sh:
  ```bash
  grep -l "artifact-operations" .claude/tests/*.sh
  ```
- [ ] For each test, update source statements
- [ ] Update any mock paths or expectations:
  ```bash
  # OLD: expect "artifact-operations.sh"
  # NEW: expect "artifact-creation.sh" and "artifact-registry.sh"
  ```
- [ ] Run full test suite:
  ```bash
  cd .claude/tests
  ./run_all_tests.sh
  ```
- [ ] Fix any test failures related to library migration
- [ ] Verify test baseline maintained (60/69 minimum, 87%)

**Testing**:
```bash
# Full test suite run
./run_all_tests.sh | tee test_output.txt

# Count passing tests
PASSING=$(grep -c "✓" test_output.txt)
echo "Passing: $PASSING/69 tests"

# Baseline check: must be ≥60
if [ $PASSING -ge 60 ]; then
  echo "✓ Baseline maintained"
else
  echo "✗ Baseline dropped - investigate failures"
fi
```

**Expected Outcome**: Test suite runs successfully, baseline maintained (60/69), no artifact-operations.sh references.

---

### Phase 5: Update Documentation and Verify [COMPLETED]

**Objective**: Update all documentation to reflect new library architecture, verify completeness

**Complexity**: Low-Medium - Systematic documentation updates

**Status**: ✅ Completed - Updated command-development-guide.md, all active docs clean

**Files to Update**:

#### Library Documentation
- [ ] `.claude/lib/README.md` - Update library inventory to show artifact-creation.sh and artifact-registry.sh as separate libraries
- [ ] `.claude/lib/artifact-creation.sh` - Verify inline documentation is current
- [ ] `.claude/lib/artifact-registry.sh` - Verify inline documentation is current

#### Standards Documentation
- [ ] `.claude/docs/reference/library-api.md` - Update function reference to show new library locations
- [ ] `.claude/docs/guides/command-development-guide.md` - Update examples to source new libraries
- [ ] `.claude/docs/guides/agent-development-guide.md` - Update agent examples

#### Cross-References
- [ ] Search for all artifact-operations.sh mentions in documentation:
  ```bash
  grep -r "artifact-operations" .claude/docs/ --include="*.md" | \
    grep -v "\.git" | \
    wc -l
  ```
- [ ] Update each documentation file to show new pattern
- [ ] Remove historical references (per clean-break philosophy)

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Update library README with new inventory
- [ ] Update API reference documentation
- [ ] Update command/agent development guides
- [ ] Remove all artifact-operations.sh references from docs
- [ ] Verify no historical markers remain ("previously", "used to be", etc.)
- [ ] Comprehensive verification:
  ```bash
  # Verify zero artifact-operations.sh references in active code
  echo "=== Verification Report ==="
  echo ""
  echo "Commands:"
  grep -r "artifact-operations" .claude/commands/ --include="*.md" | wc -l
  echo ""
  echo "Agents:"
  grep -r "artifact-operations" .claude/agents/ --include="*.md" | wc -l
  echo ""
  echo "Libraries:"
  grep -r "artifact-operations" .claude/lib/ --include="*.sh" | \
    grep -v "artifact-creation\|artifact-registry" | wc -l
  echo ""
  echo "Tests:"
  grep -r "artifact-operations" .claude/tests/ --include="*.sh" | wc -l
  echo ""
  echo "Documentation:"
  grep -r "artifact-operations" .claude/docs/ --include="*.md" | wc -l
  echo ""
  echo "Expected: All counts = 0"
  ```

**Testing**:
```bash
# Run full test suite one final time
./run_all_tests.sh

# Test /coordinate command end-to-end
# This verifies Phase 0 + library migration working together
```

**Expected Outcome**: All documentation updated, zero artifact-operations.sh references, tests passing, /coordinate functional.

## Testing Strategy

### Test Execution Timeline

- **After Phase 1**: Quick smoke test (library loading)
- **After Phase 2**: Agent invocation test
- **After Phase 3**: Library sourcing test (all libraries)
- **After Phase 4**: Full test suite run (baseline verification)
- **After Phase 5**: Final comprehensive test run
- **Phase 6**: Post-commit sanity check

### Test Categories

1. **Library Loading Tests**: Verify new libraries source without errors
2. **Function Export Tests**: Verify all functions properly exported
3. **Integration Tests**: Command workflows end-to-end
4. **Regression Tests**: Known failure patterns don't reappear
5. **Migration Tests**: Zero artifact-operations.sh references

### Success Threshold

- **Baseline**: 60/69 tests passing (87%)
- **Target**: 60/69 or better
- **Blocking Condition**: Dropping below baseline blocks commit
- **Action on Failure**: Fix failing tests before proceeding to Phase 6

### Test Fixing Strategy

If tests fail after any phase:

1. **Identify root cause**: Missing library source? Function not exported? Path mismatch?
2. **Analyze impact**: Is it migration-related or pre-existing?
3. **Fix immediately**: Update library sources, fix function exports, correct paths
4. **Re-run tests**: Verify fix resolves failure
5. **Proceed only when baseline met**: Do not continue with failures

**Philosophy**: Clean-break means fixing all migration issues immediately, not deferring failures.

### Test Command

```bash
cd /home/benjamin/.config/.claude/tests
./run_all_tests.sh
```

## Rollback Strategy

### Clean-Break Approach

No forward compatibility or shims:
- **Rollback mechanism**: `git revert <commit-hash>` only
- **No shims**: Use git history for previous versions
- **No compatibility flags**: Changes are permanent or reverted

### Rollback Procedure

If issues discovered after commit:

1. **Identify commit**: `git log --oneline --grep="unified library architecture"`
2. **Revert commit**: `git revert <commit-hash>`
3. **Verify tests**: Run test suite to confirm restoration
4. **Investigate**: Analyze failure cause before retry

### Expected Errors (Fail-Fast Behavior)

After migration, commands attempting to source artifact-operations.sh produce immediate errors:

```bash
# Example fail-fast error
bash: .claude/lib/artifact-operations.sh: No such file or directory

# This is DESIRED behavior - clear signal that migration is complete
```

## Risk Assessment

### Low-Medium Risk Factors

1. **Reference Count**: 48 files need updates
2. **Function Compatibility**: All functions unchanged (low risk)
3. **Test Coverage**: Some edge cases may not be tested

### Mitigation Strategies

1. **Phase-by-phase testing**: Catch issues early
2. **Comprehensive grep**: Verify 0 references after each phase
3. **Manual review**: Check git diff before final commit
4. **Baseline protection**: Block commit if tests drop below 60/69

### Low Risk Justification

- All functions remain unchanged (only source file changes)
- New libraries already exist and work on spec_org branch
- Test suite provides rapid feedback
- Single commit enables easy rollback
- No shims means no technical debt added

## Dependencies

### Required Files (Already Exist)

- `/home/benjamin/.config/.claude/lib/artifact-creation.sh` ✓
- `/home/benjamin/.config/.claude/lib/artifact-registry.sh` ✓
- `/home/benjamin/.config/.claude/lib/library-sourcing.sh` ✓
- `/home/benjamin/.config/.claude/lib/workflow-initialization.sh` ✓

### Test Infrastructure

- `/home/benjamin/.config/.claude/tests/run_all_tests.sh` ✓
- All test files in `/home/benjamin/.config/.claude/tests/` ✓

## Constraints and Trade-offs

### Architectural Benefits

**Zero-Shim Migration Advantages**:
- No technical debt from compatibility layers
- Clear failure modes (missing file errors)
- Forces completion of migration
- Cleaner architecture long-term

**Trade-off**: Requires updating all 48 files at once (mitigated by atomic commit enabling easy rollback)

### Function Compatibility

**All functions unchanged** - only source location changes:
- **Benefit**: Zero risk of function signature breakage
- **Trade-off**: None - this is purely a file reorganization

### Test Baseline Maintenance

**Baseline: 60/69 (87%)**:
- **Constraint**: Must not drop below baseline
- **Benefit**: Quality gate prevents regressions
- **Trade-off**: May need to fix unrelated test failures if they appear

## Success Metrics

### Completion Criteria

- [ ] 0 references to artifact-operations.sh in active code
- [ ] 48 files updated to source new libraries
- [ ] artifact-creation.sh sourced correctly (267 lines)
- [ ] artifact-registry.sh sourced correctly (410 lines)
- [ ] 60/69 tests passing (87% baseline maintained)
- [ ] /coordinate command executes successfully
- [ ] Single atomic git commit
- [ ] Documentation reflects new architecture only
- [ ] Zero shims or compatibility layers added

### Quality Metrics

- **Code Cleanliness**: No backward compatibility code, no shims
- **Test Stability**: Baseline maintained or improved
- **Documentation**: Current state only, no historical markers
- **Fail-Fast Behavior**: Missing libraries produce immediate errors
- **Rollback Ready**: Single commit enables clean revert

## Timeline Estimate

### Phase Duration Estimates

- **Phase 1**: 30 minutes (27 commands, simple pattern)
- **Phase 2**: 15 minutes (6 agents, same pattern)
- **Phase 3**: 20 minutes (5 libraries, verify no circular deps)
- **Phase 4**: 30 minutes (multiple tests, may need fixes)
- **Phase 5**: 30 minutes (documentation updates)
- **Phase 6**: 15 minutes (verification and commit)

**Total Estimated Duration**: 2 hours 20 minutes

**Buffer for Issues**: +40 minutes

**Total with Buffer**: 3 hours

## Notes

This plan implements a **zero-shim migration** following the project's clean-break philosophy:
- No compatibility layers or shims added
- Fail-fast errors are desired (clear signal migration complete)
- Git history for rollback, no archive files
- Production ready means tests pass AND architecture clean
- Single atomic commit with all changes

The migration preserves all architectural improvements from spec_org branch:
- Split-library pattern (artifact-creation + artifact-registry)
- Consolidated library sourcing (library-sourcing.sh)
- Atomic topic allocation (unified-location-detection.sh)
- Phase 0 optimization (commit 1d0eeb70)

**Key Insight**: No functions changed, only source file locations. This makes migration low-risk and straightforward.

## Advantages Over Shim Approach

This zero-shim migration is superior to the research report's "restore artifact-operations.sh as temporary shim" recommendation because:

1. **No Technical Debt**: Zero compatibility layers means cleaner codebase immediately
2. **Simpler Long-Term**: No need for eventual shim removal (already done)
3. **Clear Failure Modes**: Missing file errors are more obvious than broken shims
4. **Aligns with Philosophy**: Clean-break approach means direct migration, not gradual transition
5. **Same Effort**: Updating 48 files takes ~2-3 hours whether shim exists or not
6. **Better Outcome**: Production-ready architecture immediately, not "temporary fix + future migration"

**Trade-off Accepted**: Requires updating all files at once (mitigated by atomic commit + easy rollback).
