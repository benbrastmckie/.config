- **Created**: 2025-10-23
- **Status**: Active
- **Complexity**: 6.5/10
- **Estimated Duration**: 6-9 weeks

## Objective
Integrate Claude Code skills system into existing .claude/ configuration while maintaining compliance with .claude/docs/ standards and creating systematic documentation for the new skill implementation.

## Research Reports
- [Skills System Architecture](../reports/001_skills_system_architecture.md)
- [Claude Config Compliance](../reports/002_claude_config_compliance.md)
- [Documentation Standards](../reports/003_documentation_standards.md)

## Success Criteria
- Skills system integrated with existing .claude/ architecture
- Documentation standards applied to all skill files
- Context management patterns implemented for skills
- Skills registry system operational
- All 4 research reports integrated into implementation
- User can review progress at each stage before proceeding

## Risk Assessment
- **Low Risk**: Adopting pre-built skills from obra/superpowers (battle-tested, community-validated)
- **Medium Risk**: Creating custom meta-level enforcement skills (new pattern, requires testing)
- **Low Risk**: Documentation infrastructure (extends existing patterns)
- **Medium Risk**: Integration with current behavioral injection architecture (requires careful coordination)

## Complexity Assessment
**Overall Complexity**: 6.5/10

- Multi-phase refactor with 6 distinct stages
- Integration across multiple system layers (commands, agents, utilities, documentation)
- Balance between preservation (orchestration) and innovation (skills)
- Requires user review checkpoints at each stage
- **Efficiency Factors**: Extends agent-registry-utils.sh (90% code overlap), uses unified-location-detection.sh (85% token reduction, 36x speedup), leverages 9 documented architectural patterns

**Estimated Duration**: 6-9 weeks

**Phase Duration Breakdown**:
- Phase 0: 1 week (documentation foundation)
- Phase 1: 1 week (extend existing registry infrastructure)
- Phase 2: 1-2 weeks (obra/superpowers integration)
- Phase 3: 1 week (Anthropic document skills)
- Phase 4: 1-2 weeks (custom guidance skills, pre-commit hooks)
- Phase 5: 2-3 weeks (command integration and agent migration)
- Phase 6: 1 week (validation and optimization with existing documentation)

**Existing Infrastructure**:
- **agent-registry-utils.sh**: Registry patterns, frontmatter parsing, metadata extraction, caching
- **unified-location-detection.sh**: Location detection, directory creation, topic numbering (85% token reduction, 36x speedup)
- **artifact-creation.sh**: Lazy directory creation (`ensure_artifact_directory()`), artifact path calculation
- **Documented Patterns** (9 files): behavioral-injection, metadata-extraction, verification-fallback, checkpoint-recovery, context-management, forward-message, hierarchical-supervision, parallel-execution, README
- **Clean Infrastructure**: 266KB library consolidation, 25 scripts archived, /research command provides hierarchical multi-agent research

### Phase 4: Custom Meta-Level Enforcement Skills
**Status**: Pending
**Objective**: Create project-specific skills that provide guidance and enforce testable standards from CLAUDE.md
**Complexity**: 6/10
**Duration**: 1-2 weeks

#### Dependencies
- Phase 3 must be complete
- User approval of document skills integration required

#### Rationale: Skills vs Libraries for Enforcement
Skills excel at providing guidance and making context-aware decisions, not enforcing deterministic rules. Deterministic enforcement (indentation, line length, timeless writing) belongs in unified libraries and pre-commit hooks. Skills should focus on subjective judgment (code quality, test completeness, debugging strategies).

#### Tasks
1. Create code-standards-guidance skill
   - Location: `.claude/skills/enforcers/code-standards-guidance/SKILL.md`
   - Read CLAUDE.md ## Code Standards section
   - Detect file type from extension
   - Extract language-specific standards
   - Provide guidance on code organization, naming conventions, error handling patterns
   - Focus on subjective quality (not deterministic rules like indentation)
   - Use allowed-tools: Read, Edit (restrict Write for safety)
   - Note: Deterministic checks (indentation, line length) handled by pre-commit hooks

2. Create testing-protocols-guidance skill
   - Location: `.claude/skills/enforcers/testing-protocols-guidance/SKILL.md`
   - Read CLAUDE.md ## Testing Protocols section
   - Provide guidance on test coverage strategies
   - Suggest test patterns for edge cases
   - Recommend integration vs unit test approaches
   - Use allowed-tools: Read, Bash (for test execution)
   - Note: Coverage thresholds enforced by test runners, skill provides strategic guidance

3. Reference systematic-debugging skill from obra/superpowers (no custom skill needed)
   - obra/superpowers provides systematic-debugging and root-cause-tracing skills
   - These provide 4-phase investigation methodology
   - No need to create custom debugging skill, leverage community-validated patterns

4. Update CLAUDE.md sections with links
   - Add file path references in ## Code Standards
   - Add file path references in ## Testing Protocols
   - Document where standards are defined (links to detailed files)
   - Note: ## Documentation Policy enforcement handled by pre-commit hooks (no skill needed)

5. Test automatic activation
   - Edit .lua file â†’ code-standards-guidance activates
   - Run /test-all â†’ testing-protocols-guidance activates
   - Invoke /debug â†’ systematic-debugging skill (obra/superpowers) activates
   - Verify standards read from CLAUDE.md correctly

6. Measure token reduction
   - Baseline: Commands load standards sections directly (~6000 tokens)
   - With skills: Skills dormant (90 tokens), activate on demand (6000 tokens first time, cached)
   - Expected savings: 96% reduction baseline, standards cached across phases

#### Testing
- Test each guidance skill independently
- Validate standards discovery across project types
- Verify guidance quality (subjective vs deterministic)
- Test skill portability (same skill, different project with different standards)
- Measure token usage before/after
- Verify pre-commit hooks handle deterministic enforcement

#### Success Criteria
- 2 custom guidance skills created and tested (code, testing)
- obra/superpowers debugging skills integrated
- CLAUDE.md updated with file path references
- Automatic activation verified
- Token reduction validated (â‰¥90% expected)
- Skills portable across projects
- Deterministic enforcement delegated to pre-commit hooks
- **USER REVIEW CHECKPOINT**: Review guidance behavior before command integration

#### Artifacts Created
- `.claude/skills/enforcers/code-standards-guidance/SKILL.md`
- `.claude/skills/enforcers/testing-protocols-guidance/SKILL.md`
- `CLAUDE.md` (file path references in Code Standards and Testing Protocols sections)
- Note: Documentation standards enforcement delegated to pre-commit hooks

## Implementation Notes

### Preservation Strategy
- **PRESERVE**: Orchestration layer (commands, behavioral injection, hierarchical agents)
- **PRESERVE**: Progressive plan structures (L0 â†’ L1 â†’ L2 expansion)
- **PRESERVE**: Adaptive planning (complexity-based replanning)
- **PRESERVE**: Checkpoint recovery (resumable workflows)
- **ADOPT**: Skills for standards enforcement, methodologies, quality gates
- **ADOPT**: obra/superpowers collaboration patterns
- **REPLACE**: Custom doc-converter with Anthropic document skills

### Rollback Mechanisms
- Each phase has user review checkpoint
- Git tags at each phase completion for rollback points
- Performance baselines captured for comparison
- Validation suite ensures no regressions
- Incremental migration allows partial rollback

### Context Management Strategy
- Skills dormant: 30-50 tokens per skill
- Skills activated: 500-2000 tokens typical
- Metadata-only returns after execution: 95-99% reduction
- Context pruning after skill completion
- Target maintained: <30% context usage (stretch goal: <23%)

### Risk Mitigation
- Start with low-risk ecosystem skills (obra/superpowers, Anthropic)
- Test in isolated workflows before full integration
- Measure performance at each phase
- User review checkpoints prevent runaway changes
- Preserve orchestration layer (no migration of critical paths)
