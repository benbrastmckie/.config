# State Variable Persistence and Verification Coverage Map
# Generated: $(date)

## Critical State Variables

### WORKFLOW_ID (line 157)
- Persisted: ✓ append_workflow_state
- Verification: ✗ No immediate verification checkpoint
- Recommendation: Add verify_state_variable after line 157

### WORKFLOW_DESCRIPTION (line 158)  
- Persisted: ✓ append_workflow_state (using SAVED_WORKFLOW_DESC)
- Verification: ✗ No immediate verification checkpoint
- Recommendation: Add verify_state_variable after line 158

### CLASSIFICATION_JSON (set by agent)
- Persisted: ✓ By workflow-classifier agent
- Verification: ✓ Lines 224-245 check state file for CLASSIFICATION_JSON
- Status: COMPLIANT

### WORKFLOW_SCOPE (line 321)
- Persisted: ✓ append_workflow_state
- Verification: ✓ Lines 326-328 verify_state_variable
- Status: COMPLIANT

### RESEARCH_COMPLEXITY (line 397)
- Persisted: ✓ append_workflow_state
- Verification: ✗ No immediate verification checkpoint
- Recommendation: Add verify_state_variable after line 397

### RESEARCH_TOPICS_JSON (line 398)
- Persisted: ✓ append_workflow_state
- Verification: ✗ No immediate verification checkpoint
- Recommendation: Add verify_state_variable after line 398

### TOPIC_PATH (line 393)
- Persisted: ✓ append_workflow_state
- Verification: ✗ No immediate verification checkpoint (indirect check at line 389)
- Recommendation: Add verify_state_variable after line 393

### PLAN_PATH (line 394)
- Persisted: ✓ append_workflow_state
- Verification: ✗ No immediate verification checkpoint
- Recommendation: Add verify_state_variable after line 394

### Array Variables (REPORT_PATHS)
- Persisted: ✓ Indexed export pattern (lines 403-408)
- Count persisted: ✓ REPORT_PATHS_COUNT (line 401)
- Verification: ✗ No verification of indexed variables
- Recommendation: Add defensive array reconstruction verification

## Verification Coverage Statistics
- Variables with persistence: 15+
- Variables with immediate verification: 2 (13%)
- Target: 100% verification coverage

## Gaps Summary
1. Missing immediate verification after most append_workflow_state calls
2. No defensive array reconstruction verification
3. No batch verification for multiple related variables

## Recommendations for Phase 3
1. Add verify_state_variable after each critical append_workflow_state
2. Implement defensive array reconstruction with count verification
3. Add batch verification for related variable groups (e.g., all path variables)
