# Return Code Verification Gaps Analysis
# Generated: $(date)

## Critical Functions Found

### sm_init (line 279)
STATUS: ✓ HAS return code check
PATTERN: sm_init call with SM_INIT_EXIT_CODE capture and verification
VERIFICATION: Lines 280-283 check exit code
POST-CHECK: Lines 286-299 verify exported variables

### initialize_workflow_paths (line 378)
STATUS: ✓ HAS return code check (via if statement)
PATTERN: if initialize_workflow_paths ... ; then
VERIFICATION: Lines 378-385 check return code
POST-CHECK: Lines 387-390 verify TOPIC_PATH was set

### source_required_libraries (line 359)
STATUS: ✓ HAS return code check (via if statement)
PATTERN: if source_required_libraries ... ; then
VERIFICATION: Lines 359-376 check return code and handle errors

### classify_workflow_comprehensive
STATUS: NOT DIRECTLY CALLED (classification done via workflow-classifier agent)
PATTERN: Agent-based classification, not direct function call
NOTE: Classification JSON verified at lines 224-245

## Summary
- All critical initialization functions have return code verification
- State verification checkpoints present after critical operations
- No gaps identified in current implementation

## Recommendation
- Current implementation is compliant with Standard 16
- Focus on verification checkpoint integration (Phase 4) rather than adding new return code checks
