# Delegation Pattern Analysis - Why /coordinate Shifted from Direct Operations to Delegation

## Metadata
- **Date**: 2025-10-29
- **Agent**: research-specialist
- **Topic**: Delegation Pattern Analysis in /coordinate Command
- **Report Type**: Architectural decision analysis
- **Overview Report**: [OVERVIEW.md](OVERVIEW.md)

## Executive Summary

The /coordinate command was designed from inception (October 27, 2025) with pure delegation architecture, NOT through a shift from direct operations. Analysis of git history reveals /coordinate was created by copying /supervise (commit 1179e2e1), which already embodied the "orchestrator-never-executes" pattern. The architectural prohibition against SlashCommand tool usage and direct file operations was inherited from /supervise, not added later as a correction. This represents an intentional architectural decision to enforce role separation between orchestrators and executors.

## Findings

### 1. Creation Timeline and Origin

**Finding**: /coordinate was created on October 27, 2025 (commit 1179e2e1) by copying /supervise command.

**Evidence**:
- Commit message: "feat(491): complete Phase 1 - Foundation and Baseline"
- Initial file: 2,180 lines, copied from /supervise.md
- All references renamed from /supervise to /coordinate
- Metadata included `dependent-commands: research, plan, implement, debug, test, document` (line 6)

**Significance**: /coordinate inherited /supervise's architectural patterns, including prohibition against SlashCommand usage.

**File References**:
- `.claude/commands/coordinate.md` (lines 1-10, initial metadata)
- Git commit 1179e2e1

### 2. Architectural Prohibition - Present from Inception

**Finding**: The prohibition against SlashCommand usage and direct operations was present from /coordinate's creation, NOT added later.

**Evidence from Current /coordinate.md**:

Lines 42-109 contain "Architectural Prohibition: No Command Chaining" section with:

```markdown
**CRITICAL PROHIBITION**: This command MUST NEVER invoke other commands via the SlashCommand tool.

**YOU MUST NEVER**:
1. Execute tasks yourself using Read/Grep/Write/Edit tools
2. Invoke other commands via SlashCommand tool (/plan, /implement, /debug, /document)
3. Modify or create files directly (except in Phase 0 setup)
```

Lines 70-109 provide detailed rationale:
- **Context Bloat**: SlashCommand expands entire command prompts (~2000 lines each)
- **Broken Behavioral Injection**: Commands invoked via SlashCommand cannot receive custom context
- **Lost Control**: Orchestrator cannot inject specific instructions
- **No Metadata**: Get full output instead of structured data

**Evidence from /supervise.md** (parent command):

Lines 42-109 contain IDENTICAL prohibition language, confirming this was the source pattern.

**File References**:
- `.claude/commands/coordinate.md:42-109` (prohibition section)
- `.claude/commands/supervise.md:42-109` (identical prohibition)

### 3. "Orchestrator vs Executor" Role Separation

**Finding**: /coordinate enforces strict role separation where orchestrators ONLY delegate, never execute.

**Evidence**:

Lines 34-40 define orchestrator responsibilities:
```markdown
**YOUR ROLE**: WORKFLOW ORCHESTRATOR

**YOUR RESPONSIBILITIES**:
1. Pre-calculate ALL artifact paths before any agent invocations
2. Determine workflow scope (research-only, research-and-plan, full-implementation, debug-only)
3. Invoke specialized agents via Task tool with complete context injection
4. Verify agent outputs at mandatory checkpoints
5. Extract and aggregate metadata from agent results
6. Report final workflow status and artifact locations
```

Lines 42-49 explicitly prohibit execution activities:
```markdown
**YOU MUST NEVER**:
1. Execute tasks yourself using Read/Grep/Write/Edit tools
2. Invoke other commands via SlashCommand tool
3. Modify or create files directly (except in Phase 0 setup)
4. Skip mandatory verification checkpoints
5. Continue workflow after verification failure
```

**Rationale**: Clear separation prevents role confusion and ensures:
- Orchestrators focus on coordination, not implementation
- All file operations performed by specialized agents
- Verification points between delegation and continuation
- Predictable context usage (orchestrator context doesn't bloat with execution details)

**File References**:
- `.claude/commands/coordinate.md:34-49` (role definition)

### 4. Task Tool vs SlashCommand Tool Comparison

**Finding**: /coordinate mandates Task tool for agent invocation, prohibits SlashCommand tool usage.

**Evidence - Task Tool Pattern** (lines 88-103):

```yaml
# ✅ CORRECT - Do this instead
Task {
  subagent_type: "general-purpose"
  description: "Create implementation plan"
  prompt: "
    Read and follow ALL behavioral guidelines from: .claude/agents/plan-architect.md

    **Workflow-Specific Context**:
    - Plan Path: ${PLAN_PATH} (absolute path, pre-calculated)
    - Research Reports: [list of paths]
    - Project Standards: [path to CLAUDE.md]

    Execute planning following all guidelines in behavioral file.
    Return: PLAN_CREATED: ${PLAN_PATH}
  "
}
```

**Benefits** (lines 105-109):
1. Lean Context: Only agent behavioral guidelines loaded (~200 lines)
2. Behavioral Control: Can inject custom instructions, constraints, templates
3. Structured Output: Agent returns metadata (path, status) not full summaries
4. Verification Points: Can verify file creation before continuing

**SlashCommand Anti-Pattern** (lines 77-84):

```yaml
# ❌ INCORRECT - Do NOT do this
SlashCommand {
  command: "/plan create auth feature"
}
```

**Problems**:
1. Context Bloat: Entire /plan command prompt injected (~2000 lines)
2. Broken Behavioral Injection: /plan's behavior not customizable
3. Lost Control: Cannot inject specific instructions
4. No Metadata: Get full output, not structured data

**File References**:
- `.claude/commands/coordinate.md:70-109` (comparison section)

### 5. Phase 2 (Planning) as Example of Delegation Pattern

**Finding**: Phase 2 demonstrates pure delegation pattern - orchestrator calculates paths, delegates to plan-architect agent, verifies output.

**Evidence from Phase 2 Implementation** (lines 1011-1152):

**Step 1: Context Preparation** (lines 1035-1063)
- Orchestrator builds research reports list
- Discovers standards file
- Does NOT read report contents or create plan

**Step 2: Agent Invocation** (lines 1065-1088)
```markdown
**EXECUTE NOW**: USE the Task tool with these parameters:

- subagent_type: "general-purpose"
- description: "Create implementation plan with mandatory file creation"
- prompt: |
    Read and follow ALL behavioral guidelines from:
    /home/benjamin/.config/.claude/agents/plan-architect.md

    **Workflow-Specific Context**:
    - Workflow Description: $WORKFLOW_DESCRIPTION
    - Plan File Path: $PLAN_PATH (absolute path, pre-calculated)
    - Project Standards: $STANDARDS_FILE
    - Research Reports: $RESEARCH_REPORTS_LIST
```

**Step 3: Mandatory Verification** (lines 1090-1114)
```bash
echo -n "Verifying implementation plan: "

if verify_file_created "$PLAN_PATH" "Implementation plan" "Phase 2"; then
  PHASE_COUNT=$(grep -c "^### Phase [0-9]" "$PLAN_PATH" || echo "0")
  # ... verification logic
else
  echo "Workflow TERMINATED: Fix plan creation and retry"
  exit 1
fi
```

**Pattern Summary**:
1. Orchestrator pre-calculates $PLAN_PATH (Phase 0)
2. Orchestrator prepares context (research report paths, standards file)
3. Orchestrator delegates to plan-architect agent via Task tool
4. Agent creates plan file at pre-calculated path
5. Orchestrator verifies file exists before continuing
6. Orchestrator extracts metadata (phase count, complexity) from created file

**File References**:
- `.claude/commands/coordinate.md:1011-1152` (Phase 2 implementation)
- `.claude/agents/plan-architect.md` (delegated agent)

### 6. Comparison with /orchestrate and /supervise

**Finding**: All three orchestration commands (/coordinate, /orchestrate, /supervise) enforce the same delegation pattern with identical prohibition language.

**Evidence**:

**/coordinate** (lines 42-109): Contains full prohibition section
**/supervise** (lines 42-109): Contains IDENTICAL prohibition section
**/orchestrate** (lines 10-36): Contains HTML comment prohibition at top of file

From `.claude/commands/orchestrate.md:10-36`:
```html
<!-- ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════ -->
<!-- CRITICAL ARCHITECTURAL PATTERN - DO NOT VIOLATE                 -->
<!-- ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════ -->
<!-- /orchestrate MUST NEVER invoke other slash commands             -->
<!-- FORBIDDEN TOOLS: SlashCommand                                   -->
<!-- REQUIRED PATTERN: Task tool → Specialized agents                -->
```

**Rationale from /orchestrate** (lines 17-24):
```html
<!-- WHY THIS MATTERS:                                               -->
<!-- 1. Context Bloat: SlashCommand expands entire command prompts  -->
<!--    (3000+ tokens each), consuming valuable context window      -->
<!-- 2. Broken Behavioral Injection: Commands invoked via            -->
<!--    SlashCommand cannot receive artifact path context from       -->
<!--    location-specialist, breaking topic-based organization       -->
<!-- 3. Lost Control: Orchestrator cannot customize agent behavior,  -->
<!--    inject topic numbers, or ensure artifacts in correct paths   -->
```

**Consistency Finding**: All three commands share:
- Prohibition against SlashCommand usage
- Requirement to use Task tool for delegation
- Same rationale (context bloat, behavioral injection, control)
- Same enforcement language ("MUST NEVER", "FORBIDDEN", "CRITICAL")

**File References**:
- `.claude/commands/coordinate.md:42-109`
- `.claude/commands/supervise.md:42-109`
- `.claude/commands/orchestrate.md:10-36`

### 7. What Operations Were Replaced (Historical Context from /orchestrate)

**Finding**: Earlier versions of orchestration commands likely used SlashCommand tool, but this was eliminated before /coordinate was created.

**Evidence from /orchestrate metadata** (lines 1-7):
```yaml
allowed-tools: Task, TodoWrite, Read, Write, Bash, Grep, Glob
dependent-commands: research, plan, implement, debug, test, document, github-specialist
```

Note: SlashCommand NOT in allowed-tools list.

**Inference from Prohibition Language**: The detailed prohibition sections in all three commands suggest this was a lesson learned from earlier implementations. The specificity of the problems described (context bloat, broken behavioral injection, lost control) indicates these were real issues encountered and systematically addressed.

**Historical Pattern Shift** (inferred):

**Before** (pre-October 2025, not in /coordinate history):
- Orchestrators invoked `/plan`, `/implement`, `/debug` via SlashCommand
- Full command prompts loaded into context (2000-5000+ lines each)
- Orchestrator context bloated to >100k tokens
- Path calculation handled by individual commands, inconsistent organization

**After** (October 2025, /supervise → /coordinate):
- Orchestrators invoke agents directly via Task tool
- Only agent behavioral guidelines loaded (~200 lines)
- Orchestrator context stays <30% throughout workflow
- Path calculation centralized in Phase 0 (orchestrator responsibility)

**File References**:
- `.claude/commands/orchestrate.md:1-7` (metadata)
- `.claude/commands/coordinate.md:42-109` (prohibition rationale)

### 8. Architectural Decision or Accidental Regression?

**Finding**: ARCHITECTURAL DECISION - The delegation pattern in /coordinate is intentional, systematic, and inherited from /supervise.

**Evidence Supporting Architectural Decision**:

1. **Explicit Prohibition Sections**: 68 lines dedicated to explaining why SlashCommand is forbidden (lines 42-109)

2. **Documented Rationale**: Four specific problems with command chaining documented in detail:
   - Context bloat (2000+ lines per command)
   - Broken behavioral injection
   - Lost control over agent behavior
   - No structured metadata output

3. **Enforcement Mechanisms** (lines 124-132):
   ```markdown
   If you find yourself wanting to invoke /plan, /implement, /debug, or /document:

   1. **STOP** - You are about to violate the architectural pattern
   2. **IDENTIFY** - What task does that command perform?
   3. **DELEGATE** - Invoke the appropriate agent directly via Task tool
   4. **INJECT** - Provide the agent with behavioral guidelines and context
   5. **VERIFY** - Check that the agent created the expected artifacts
   ```

4. **Success Criteria** (line 1820):
   ```markdown
   - [ ] Pure orchestration: Zero SlashCommand tool invocations
   ```

5. **Consistent Pattern Across Commands**: /coordinate, /supervise, and /orchestrate all enforce identical pattern

6. **allowed-tools Metadata** (line 2):
   ```yaml
   allowed-tools: Task, TodoWrite, Bash, Read
   ```
   Note: SlashCommand explicitly excluded

**No Evidence of Regression**: Git history shows:
- /coordinate created with delegation pattern (commit 1179e2e1)
- No commits showing reversion to SlashCommand usage
- No commits titled "fix regression" or "restore delegation"
- Only refinements to existing delegation pattern (commits 42cf20cb, 36270604, etc.)

**Conclusion**: This is a deliberate architectural decision, not an accidental regression. The system was explicitly designed to prevent command chaining in favor of direct agent delegation.

- `.claude/commands/coordinate.md:42-109` (prohibition)
- `.claude/commands/coordinate.md:124-132` (enforcement)
- `.claude/commands/coordinate.md:1820` (success criteria)

## Recommendations

### 1. Document the Architectural Evolution

**Rationale**: While /coordinate inherited the delegation pattern from /supervise, the historical context of why this pattern was adopted is not fully documented.

**Action**: Create an architectural decision record (ADR) documenting:
- When SlashCommand usage was eliminated from orchestration commands
- What problems it solved (context bloat, behavioral injection, etc.)
- Performance metrics (context usage before/after)
- Migration path for any remaining commands using SlashCommand

**Location**: `.claude/docs/decisions/001_orchestrator_delegation_pattern.md`

### 2. Validate Prohibition Enforcement

**Rationale**: The prohibition is documented but enforcement relies on developer discipline and code review.

**Action**: Create validation script to detect SlashCommand usage in orchestration commands:
```bash
# .claude/lib/validate-orchestration-pattern.sh
# Scan orchestration commands for SlashCommand usage
# Exit 1 if found, preventing commit via pre-commit hook
```

**Integration**: Add to test suite and pre-commit hooks

### 3. Cross-Reference Agent Behavioral Files

**Rationale**: Lines 1713-1751 reference six agent behavioral files (research-specialist, plan-architect, implementer-coordinator, implementation-executor, test-specialist, debug-analyst) but don't link to comprehensive agent documentation.

**Action**: Add cross-reference to [Agent Reference](../../../../docs/reference/agent-reference.md) showing:
- Complete list of available agents
- When to use each agent
- Input/output contracts
- Invocation examples

**Location**: `.claude/commands/coordinate.md:1713` (after "Agent Behavioral Files" heading)
