# Recent Changes and Environmental Factors

## Overview
Investigation of recent code changes and environmental factors that may affect the supervise command's behavior.

## Research Scope
- Git commit history for supervise.md and related files
- Spec 474 implementation (lazy directory creation)
- Changes to topic-utils.sh and other library dependencies
- Environment variable dependencies
- Allowed-tools configuration
- Agent behavioral file modifications

## Findings

### Recent Changes (October 23-24, 2025)

#### Critical Fix: Code Fence Priming Effect (Commit 5771a4cf, Oct 24)
**Impact Level**: CRITICAL - Directly addresses agent delegation failure

**Root Cause Identified**:
- Code-fenced Task example in supervise.md (lines 62-79) established "documentation interpretation" pattern
- LLM interpreted ALL subsequent Task invocations as examples, not executable instructions
- Missing Bash tool in 3 agent frontmatter files (research-specialist.md, plan-architect.md, doc-writer.md)
- Code-fenced library sourcing bash blocks created execution ambiguity

**Changes Made**:
```diff
--- .claude/agents/research-specialist.md
+++ .claude/agents/research-specialist.md
-allowed-tools: Read, Write, Grep, Glob, WebSearch, WebFetch
+allowed-tools: Read, Write, Grep, Glob, WebSearch, WebFetch, Bash
```

Similar changes applied to:
- `plan-architect.md` (line 2)
- `doc-writer.md` (line 2)

**supervise.md Changes**:
- Removed code fences from Task invocation example (lines 62-79)
- Added HTML comment for clarity: `<!-- This Task invocation is executable -->`
- Unwrapped library sourcing bash block (lines 217-277)

**Measured Impact**:
- Delegation rate: 0% → 100% (all 10 Task invocations now execute)
- Context usage: >80% → <30% (metadata extraction enabled)
- Streaming fallback errors: Eliminated
- Parallel agent execution: Enabled (2-4 agents simultaneously)

**Files Changed**: 9 files, +1363 lines (includes tests and documentation)

#### Lazy Directory Creation (Spec 474, Commits ea600afd, 0ae900a4, 946ac37a, Oct 24)
**Impact Level**: MODERATE - Potential side effect on directory verification

**Changes to topic-utils.sh** (commit ea600afd):
```bash
# OLD BEHAVIOR:
create_topic_structure() {
  mkdir -p "$topic_path"
  mkdir -p "$topic_path"/{reports,plans,summaries,debug,scripts,outputs}
  # Verified all 6 subdirectories exist
}

# NEW BEHAVIOR:
create_topic_structure() {
  mkdir -p "$topic_path"
  # Only creates topic root
  # Subdirectories created on-demand when files written
}
```

**Changes to supervise.md Phase 0** (commit 0ae900a4):
- Removed eager subdirectory creation from fallback mechanism
- Updated verification checkpoint to only check topic root exists
- Removed "All 6 subdirectories verified" message
- Added inline comment: "subdirectories created on-demand"

**Changes to Agent Templates** (commit 946ac37a):
- Added `mkdir -p "$(dirname "$FILE_PATH")"` before Write tool invocations
- Updated verification checkpoints to confirm directory creation
- Applied to: research-specialist, plan-architect, debug-analyst, doc-writer, test-specialist

**Potential Side Effects**:
1. If agents fail to create parent directories before writing, file creation will fail
2. Verification checkpoints may not detect missing directories until file write
3. Error messages may be less clear (file write error vs directory missing)

**Test Results**: 45/45 tests passed (commit 2bb033b0)

---

#### Earlier Refactoring (Specs 438, 469, Oct 23-24)
**Impact Level**: LOW - Architectural improvements

**Spec 438**: Supervise command refactor (commits 0d178a1a, 40da4e21, e5d7246e)
- Removed inline YAML templates from supervise.md
- Added retry resilience for agent invocations
- Documented anti-pattern in behavioral-injection.md

**Spec 469**: Agent delegation failure root cause (commit 5771a4cf)
- Created comprehensive troubleshooting guide (agent-delegation-failure.md)
- Added code fence priming section to command-development-guide.md
- Created validation test suite (test_supervise_agent_delegation.sh)

### Environmental Factors

#### Environment Variables
```bash
CLAUDECODE=1                    # Claude Code CLI indicator
CLAUDE_CODE_ENTRYPOINT=cli     # Entry point marker
HOME=/home/benjamin            # User home directory
SHELL=/run/current-system/sw/bin/bash  # Bash shell
```

**Analysis**: Standard Claude Code environment, no custom variables affecting behavior.

#### Agent Behavioral Files - Allowed Tools Configuration

**research-specialist.md** (line 2):
```yaml
allowed-tools: Read, Write, Grep, Glob, WebSearch, WebFetch, Bash
```
- **Recent Change**: Bash added Oct 24 (commit 5771a4cf)
- **Rationale**: Needed for directory creation (`mkdir -p`) before Write tool

**plan-architect.md** (line 2):
```yaml
allowed-tools: Read, Write, Grep, Glob, WebSearch, Bash
```
- **Recent Change**: Bash added Oct 24 (commit 5771a4cf)
- **Rationale**: Needed for directory creation before plan file write

**supervise.md** (line 2):
```yaml
allowed-tools: Task, TodoWrite, Bash, Read
```
- **No Recent Changes**: Tools correctly scoped to orchestration role
- **Critical**: Task is ONLY tool for agent invocations (not SlashCommand)

#### Git Branch Context
- **Current Branch**: `spec_org`
- **Recent Activity**: 24 untracked spec directories, extensive refactoring
- **Last Main Commit**: 2bb033b0 (integration tests for lazy directory creation)

### Impact Assessment

#### Positive Changes
1. **Code Fence Fix (5771a4cf)**: Eliminated 100% agent delegation failure
2. **Tool Allowlist Updates**: Agents can now create directories before writing files
3. **Lazy Directory Creation**: Prevents empty directory proliferation
4. **Comprehensive Testing**: 45/45 integration tests, 4/4 validation tests

#### Potential Regression Vectors
1. **Directory Creation Timing**: If agent invocation doesn't properly inject `mkdir -p` instruction
2. **Verification Checkpoint Changes**: Phase 0 no longer verifies subdirectories exist upfront
3. **Error Message Clarity**: File write failures may not explicitly mention missing parent directory
4. **Agent Tool Dependencies**: Bash tool MUST be in allowed-tools for research-specialist and plan-architect

#### Risk Timeline
- **Oct 23**: Major refactoring (076, 078, 080) - potential instability window
- **Oct 24**: Three separate commits to supervise.md - potential for inconsistency
- **Oct 24**: Agent frontmatter changes (Bash tool additions) - potential tool access issues

## Recommendations

### Immediate Investigation Priorities

1. **Verify Agent Tool Access**:
   - Check if research-specialist.md has Bash in allowed-tools (line 2)
   - Verify `mkdir -p` command appears in agent invocation prompt
   - Test if Bash tool is properly accessible during agent execution

2. **Test Directory Creation Flow**:
   - Verify `/supervise` Phase 0 creates topic root successfully
   - Check if agent receives correct FILE_PATH with parent directory
   - Confirm `mkdir -p "$(dirname "$FILE_PATH")"` executes before Write

3. **Review Recent Commit Interactions**:
   - Check if multiple commits to supervise.md (0ae900a4, 5771a4cf, 946ac37a) created conflicts
   - Verify all three phases of spec 474 properly integrated
   - Test if code fence fix (5771a4cf) interfered with lazy directory changes

### Specific Test Cases

**Test 1: Agent Directory Creation**
```bash
# Invoke research-specialist with file path in non-existent subdirectory
# Expected: Agent creates reports/ directory before writing file
# Verify: File exists and directory created successfully
```

**Test 2: Phase 0 Verification**
```bash
# Run /supervise Phase 0 with research-only workflow
# Expected: Only topic root created, no subdirectories
# Verify: Topic root exists, no empty subdirectories
```

**Test 3: Tool Access Verification**
```bash
# Check agent frontmatter during execution
# Expected: Bash tool accessible to research-specialist
# Verify: Agent can execute mkdir -p command
```

### Root Cause Hypothesis

**Primary Hypothesis**: Spec 474 implementation (lazy directory creation) may not have fully propagated to all agent invocation points. If `/supervise` command invokes research-specialist without explicitly instructing it to create parent directories, the agent may fail to write files.

**Evidence Supporting Hypothesis**:
1. Commit 946ac37a added `mkdir -p` to agent templates in supervise.md
2. Commit 5771a4cf added Bash to research-specialist.md allowed-tools
3. Commit 0ae900a4 removed eager subdirectory creation from Phase 0
4. **Gap**: No verification that all agent invocations include directory creation instruction

**Next Steps**:
1. Search supervise.md for all research-specialist invocations
2. Verify each invocation includes `mkdir -p "$(dirname "$REPORT_PATH")"` instruction
3. Test research-specialist in isolation with non-existent parent directory
4. Compare working agents (plan-architect, doc-writer) vs failing agent (research-specialist)
