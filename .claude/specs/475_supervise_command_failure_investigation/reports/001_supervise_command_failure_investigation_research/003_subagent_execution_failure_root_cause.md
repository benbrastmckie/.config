# Subagent Execution Failure Root Cause

## Research Metadata
- **Topic**: Subagent execution failure in /supervise command
- **Status**: Complete
- **Created**: 2025-10-25
- **Agent**: Research Specialist

## Executive Summary

Investigation reveals that the /supervise command has already been fixed for the code fence priming effect (spec 469) that caused 0% agent delegation rate. The command now uses correct imperative invocation patterns without code fences. However, there are multiple early exit conditions in Phase 0 and phase execution checks that could prevent agents from being invoked if workflow scope detection or path calculation fails.

## Investigation Focus
1. Agent invocation patterns in supervise.md
2. Task tool usage and delegation logic
3. Known anti-patterns (spec 438 - code fence priming)
4. Verification checkpoints blocking execution
5. Phase 0 early exit conditions

## Key Findings

### 1. Agent Invocation Pattern Status (CORRECT)

The /supervise command uses the correct imperative invocation pattern for all agents:

**Lines 737, 1009, 1208, 1333, 1773**: All agent invocations follow the pattern:
```
**EXECUTE NOW**: USE the Task tool to invoke the [agent-name] agent.

Task {
  subagent_type: "general-purpose"
  description: "..."
  prompt: "
    Read and follow ALL behavioral guidelines from: .claude/agents/[agent-name].md
    ...
  "
}
```

**Evidence**: Only 1 code-fenced YAML block exists (line 49) which is an anti-pattern example showing what NOT to do. All actual Task invocations are unwrapped.

**File**: `/home/benjamin/.config/.claude/commands/supervise.md` (lines 737, 1009, 1208, 1333, 1773)

### 2. Code Fence Priming Effect (RESOLVED)

**Historical Issue** (spec 469): Code-fenced Task examples created a priming effect causing 0% delegation rate.

**Current Status**: FIXED
- Anti-pattern example at line 49 is properly fenced and marked with ❌
- All executable Task invocations are unwrapped (no code fences)
- HTML comment markers used: `<!-- This Task invocation is executable -->`

**File**: `/home/benjamin/.config/.claude/commands/supervise.md` (line 64)
**Documentation**: `/home/benjamin/.config/.claude/docs/concepts/patterns/behavioral-injection.md` (lines 414-525)

### 3. Early Exit Conditions in Phase 0 (BLOCKING RISK)

**Root Cause #1: Library Sourcing Failures**

Lines 224-275 contain 7 library source statements with hard exit on failure:

```bash
if [ -f "$SCRIPT_DIR/../lib/workflow-detection.sh" ]; then
  source "$SCRIPT_DIR/../lib/workflow-detection.sh"
else
  echo "ERROR: workflow-detection.sh not found"
  exit 1  # <-- BLOCKS ALL AGENTS
fi
```

**Impact**: If any library file is missing, command exits before reaching agent invocations.

**Location**: `/home/benjamin/.config/.claude/commands/supervise.md` (lines 224-275)

**Root Cause #2: Workflow Description Validation**

Lines 451-457: Missing workflow description causes immediate exit:

```bash
if [ -z "$WORKFLOW_DESCRIPTION" ]; then
  echo "ERROR: Workflow description required"
  echo "Usage: /supervise \"<workflow description>\""
  exit 1  # <-- BLOCKS ALL AGENTS
fi
```

**Root Cause #3: Project Root Detection Failure**

Lines 542-545: Missing project root causes exit before path calculation:

```bash
if [ -z "$PROJECT_ROOT" ]; then
  echo "ERROR: Could not determine project root"
  exit 1  # <-- BLOCKS ALL AGENTS
fi
```

**Root Cause #4: Location Metadata Validation**

Lines 566-574: Missing location/topic metadata causes exit before directory creation:

```bash
if [ -z "$LOCATION" ] || [ -z "$TOPIC_NUM" ] || [ -z "$TOPIC_NAME" ]; then
  echo "❌ ERROR: Failed to calculate location metadata"
  echo "Workflow TERMINATED."
  exit 1  # <-- BLOCKS ALL AGENTS
fi
```

**Root Cause #5: Directory Creation Failure**

Lines 599-611: Topic directory creation failure causes workflow termination:

```bash
if ! create_topic_structure "$TOPIC_PATH"; then
  # ... fallback attempt ...
  if [ ! -d "$TOPIC_PATH" ]; then
    echo "❌ FATAL: Fallback failed - directory creation impossible"
    echo "Workflow TERMINATED."
    exit 1  # <-- BLOCKS ALL AGENTS
  fi
fi
```

### 4. Phase Execution Checks (BLOCKING RISK)

**Root Cause #6: should_run_phase() Early Exits**

Lines 689-695, 963-969, 1153-1180, 1196-1201, 1321-1326: Each phase has early exit logic:

```bash
should_run_phase 1 || {
  echo "⏭️  Skipping Phase 1 (Research)"
  echo "  Reason: Workflow type is $WORKFLOW_SCOPE"
  display_completion_summary
  exit 0  # <-- SKIPS AGENTS if scope incorrect
}
```

**Impact**: If workflow scope is misdetected, agents never invoke.

**Workflow Scopes** (lines 484-502):
- `research-only`: Phases 0,1 only
- `research-and-plan`: Phases 0,1,2 only
- `full-implementation`: Phases 0,1,2,3,4,6
- `debug-only`: Phases 0,1,5 only

**Critical**: If `detect_workflow_scope()` returns wrong scope, wrong phases execute.

### 5. Verification Checkpoint Failures (BLOCKING RISK)

**Root Cause #7: Agent Output Verification Failures**

Lines 774-896: Research report verification with partial failure handling:

```bash
if retry_with_backoff 2 1000 test -f "$REPORT_PATH" -a -s "$REPORT_PATH"; then
  # Success path
else
  # Failure path - increment VERIFICATION_FAILURES
fi

# Partial failure check
if [ $VERIFICATION_FAILURES -gt 0 ]; then
  DECISION=$(handle_partial_research_failure ...)
  if [ "$DECISION" == "terminate" ]; then
    echo "Workflow TERMINATED."
    exit 1  # <-- BLOCKS subsequent phases
  fi
fi
```

**Impact**: If <50% of research agents succeed, workflow terminates before planning.

**Similar Checkpoints**:
- Lines 1040-1113: Plan creation verification (terminates if plan missing)
- Lines 1241-1306: Implementation artifacts verification (terminates if failed)
- Lines 1554-1573: Debug report verification (terminates if missing)
- Lines 1805-1818: Summary verification (terminates if missing)

### 6. Tool Access Configuration (VERIFIED)

**Allowed Tools** (line 2):
```
allowed-tools: Task, TodoWrite, Bash, Read
```

**Status**: CORRECT
- Task tool present for agent invocations
- Bash tool present for verification checkpoints
- Read tool present for metadata extraction

**Historical Issue** (spec 444): Research agents missing Bash in allowed-tools, preventing mkdir operations.

**Current Status**: Not applicable to /supervise (agents have proper tool access)

## Root Cause Summary

### Confirmed Root Causes for Agent Non-Execution

1. **Library Sourcing Failure** (lines 224-275): Missing library files cause immediate exit
2. **Workflow Description Missing** (lines 451-457): Empty description terminates before scope detection
3. **Project Root Detection Failure** (lines 542-545): Missing project root exits before path calculation
4. **Location Metadata Calculation Failure** (lines 566-574): Invalid location/topic data terminates workflow
5. **Directory Creation Failure** (lines 599-611): Cannot create topic directory terminates before agents
6. **Workflow Scope Misdetection** (lines 484-502): Wrong scope causes phase skipping via should_run_phase()
7. **Verification Checkpoint Failures** (lines 774-896, 1040-1113, etc.): Agent output verification failures terminate workflow

### Historical Issues (RESOLVED)

1. **Code Fence Priming Effect** (spec 469): FIXED - All Task invocations unwrapped
2. **Agent Tool Access** (spec 444): FIXED - Research agents have Bash in allowed-tools

## Recommendations

### 1. Add Graceful Degradation for Library Sourcing
**Priority**: HIGH

Instead of hard exit on missing libraries, provide fallback behavior:

```bash
if [ -f "$SCRIPT_DIR/../lib/workflow-detection.sh" ]; then
  source "$SCRIPT_DIR/../lib/workflow-detection.sh"
else
  echo "WARNING: workflow-detection.sh not found, using fallback"
  # Implement simple fallback scope detection
  detect_workflow_scope() {
    echo "full-implementation"  # Conservative default
  }
fi
```

### 2. Add Diagnostic Mode for Path Calculation
**Priority**: MEDIUM

When location metadata fails, emit diagnostic information before exit:

```bash
if [ -z "$LOCATION" ] || [ -z "$TOPIC_NUM" ] || [ -z "$TOPIC_NAME" ]; then
  echo "❌ ERROR: Failed to calculate location metadata"
  echo "   LOCATION: ${LOCATION:-'(empty)'}"
  echo "   TOPIC_NUM: ${TOPIC_NUM:-'(empty)'}"
  echo "   TOPIC_NAME: ${TOPIC_NAME:-'(empty)'}"
  echo ""
  echo "DIAGNOSTIC INFO:"
  echo "   PROJECT_ROOT: ${PROJECT_ROOT:-'(empty)'}"
  echo "   SPECS_ROOT: ${SPECS_ROOT:-'(empty)'}"
  echo "   WORKFLOW_DESCRIPTION: $WORKFLOW_DESCRIPTION"
  echo ""
  echo "Workflow TERMINATED."
  exit 1
fi
```

### 3. Add Workflow Scope Detection Logging
**Priority**: MEDIUM

Log scope detection decision for debugging:

```bash
WORKFLOW_SCOPE=$(detect_workflow_scope "$WORKFLOW_DESCRIPTION")

echo "Workflow Scope Detection:"
echo "  Description: $WORKFLOW_DESCRIPTION"
echo "  Detected Scope: $WORKFLOW_SCOPE"
echo "  Phases to Execute: $PHASES_TO_EXECUTE"
echo "  Phases to Skip: $SKIP_PHASES"
echo ""
```

### 4. Add Verification Checkpoint Bypass (Development Mode)
**Priority**: LOW

For testing, add environment variable to bypass verification:

```bash
if [ "$SUPERVISE_DEV_MODE" = "true" ]; then
  echo "⚠️  DEV MODE: Skipping verification checkpoint"
else
  # ... normal verification logic ...
fi
```

### 5. Add Agent Delegation Rate Test
**Priority**: HIGH

Create automated test to verify agents are actually invoking:

```bash
# .claude/tests/test_supervise_delegation_rate.sh
#!/bin/bash

echo "Testing /supervise agent delegation rate..."

# Mock workflow with scope detection
WORKFLOW_DESC="research authentication patterns to create plan"

# Run command and capture agent invocations
OUTPUT=$(echo "/supervise \"$WORKFLOW_DESC\"" | claudecode 2>&1)

# Check for agent completion signals
RESEARCH_AGENTS=$(echo "$OUTPUT" | grep -c "REPORT_CREATED:")
PLAN_AGENT=$(echo "$OUTPUT" | grep -c "PLAN_CREATED:")

echo "Agent Delegation Results:"
echo "  Research Agents: $RESEARCH_AGENTS (expected: 2-4)"
echo "  Plan Agent: $PLAN_AGENT (expected: 1)"

if [ "$RESEARCH_AGENTS" -ge 2 ] && [ "$PLAN_AGENT" -eq 1 ]; then
  echo "✓ PASS: Agent delegation working"
  exit 0
else
  echo "✗ FAIL: Agent delegation not working"
  exit 1
fi
```

## Conclusion

The /supervise command has correct imperative agent invocation patterns (post-spec 469 fix). Agent non-execution is most likely caused by:

1. **Phase 0 early exits** (7 exit points before agent invocation)
2. **Workflow scope misdetection** (causes phase skipping)
3. **Verification checkpoint failures** (terminates workflow after partial agent success)

The code fence priming effect (spec 438/469) has been successfully resolved. The command is architecturally sound but has brittle failure modes that should be improved with graceful degradation and better diagnostics.
