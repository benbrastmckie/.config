> /supervise is running… research best practices for 
orchestrator commands in claude code which call subagents 
for specific tasks. then research my existing /coordinate 
command which I am looking to improve to provide an 
efficient and economical workflow that maintains and 
improves existing functionality. draw on this research to 
create a plan to improve the current implementation of 
/coordinate 
  ⎿  Allowed 4 tools for this command

● I'll orchestrate this multi-phase workflow to research
   orchestrator best practices, analyze your /coordinate
   command, and create an improvement plan.

● Bash(SCRIPT_DIR="/home/benjamin/.config/.claude/commands"…

● Good! The paths are calculated. Let me access them
  correctly:

● Bash(# Extract paths from environment
      (workflow-initialization.sh exports them)
      echo "Phase 0 Complete - Paths calculated:"…)
  ⎿ Phase 0 Complete - Paths calculated:

● Now I'll invoke 2 research agents in parallel:

● Task(Research orchestrator best practices)
  ⎿  Done (20 tool uses · 111.4k tokens · 3m 16s)

  ⎿  Done (14 tool uses · 103.4k tokens · 3m 18s)                     

● Excellent! Both research agents completed successfully. Let me verify
   the reports:

● Workflow Complete

  I've successfully completed the research and planning workflow for
  improving your /coordinate command. Here's what was accomplished:

  Research Phase (2 parallel agents)

  1. Orchestrator Best Practices - Comprehensive analysis of patterns
  including:
    - Behavioral injection for agent invocation
    - Context management and metadata extraction
    - Verification and fallback patterns
    - Error handling strategies
    - Performance optimization techniques
    - Anti-patterns to avoid
  2. /coordinate Command Analysis - Detailed examination of:
    - Current architecture (2,148 lines)
    - Wave-based parallel execution (40-60% time savings)
    - Comparison with /supervise reference implementation
    - Specific inefficiencies and improvement opportunities

  Planning Phase

  Created an 8-phase implementation plan (22KB) with:
  - Phase 0: Validation and baseline measurement
  - Phase 1: Agent invocation pattern enhancement
  - Phase 2: Context management optimization
  - Phase 3: Verification checkpoint enhancement
  - Phase 4: Error handling enhancement
  - Phase 5: Wave execution enhancement and validation
  - Phase 6: Performance instrumentation
  - Phase 7: Documentation and decision criteria

  Estimated effort: 12-16 hours
  Complexity: Medium-High

  All artifacts are located in:
  .claude/specs/506_research_best_practices_for_orchestrator_commands_/

  To execute the plan, run:
  /implement .claude/specs/506_research_best_practices_for_orchestrator
  _commands_/plans/001_coordinate_improvement_plan.md
