# Supervise Command Regression Analysis - Research Overview

## Metadata
- **Research Topic**: Investigation of /supervise command regression where it stopped delegating research to subagents
- **Report Type**: Comprehensive synthesis of multi-angle investigation
- **Date**: 2025-10-23
- **Subtopic Reports**: 3
- **Status**: Complete

## Executive Summary

This research investigated the reported regression in the `/supervise` command where it allegedly "stopped delegating to research subagents." The investigation reveals a complex situation with **three distinct findings**:

### Critical Discovery: The Regression Is Mischaracterized

**Finding 1 (Git History Analysis)**: The `/supervise` command **HAS NOT** stopped delegating to research subagents. Phase 1 research delegation remains fully intact with complete agent invocation templates at lines 621-875. The only change was optimization of Phase 0 location detection (agent → utility functions) in commit `25b1e1ff`, which improved performance by 20x with 90% context reduction.

**Finding 2 (Agent Delegation Regression)**: Despite intact templates, the command suffers from a **critical architectural failure**: all Task tool invocations exist only as YAML documentation examples within code blocks, not as executable instructions. The command contains 934 lines of agent templates but **0 executable invocations** (0% delegation rate).

**Finding 3 (Compliance Check)**: The command achieves 75-80% compliance with hierarchical agent architecture standards but has critical gaps in metadata extraction and context pruning that prevent the pattern's 95% context reduction targets.

### The Actual Problem

The `/supervise` command defines the orchestrator role perfectly and contains comprehensive agent templates, but **never actually invokes any agents**. All Task patterns are wrapped in ```yaml code blocks as documentation, not preceded by imperative instructions like "USE the Task tool NOW."

**Impact**: 100% workflow failure rate - command terminates immediately when executed because no agents are invoked to create required artifacts.

### Root Cause

Architectural pattern confusion: treating agent invocation templates as documentation to show what should happen, rather than as executable instructions. This represents a breakdown in the behavioral injection pattern where commands must contain direct, imperative agent invocations.

## Cross-Report Synthesis

### Theme 1: Phase 0 Optimization vs Phase 1 Delegation

**From Git History Report (001)**:
- Commit `25b1e1ff` replaced location-specialist agent with utility functions
- Benefits: 90% context reduction (2000→200 tokens), 20x speed improvement
- Scope: Phase 0 ONLY - Phase 1 unchanged

**From Delegation Report (002)**:
- Phase 1 templates exist and are comprehensive (145 lines)
- Templates wrapped in YAML code blocks, not executable
- No imperative invocation instructions

**From Compliance Report (003)**:
- Phase 0 implementation quality: Strong (deterministic, verified paths)
- Phase 1 implementation quality: Templates compliant, execution missing

**Synthesis**: The Phase 0 optimization was successful and unrelated to delegation issues. The misconception that "delegation stopped" likely arose from confusion between Phase 0 agent removal (intentional optimization) and Phase 1 agent templates (unintentional documentation-only pattern).

### Theme 2: Documentation vs Execution Patterns

**From Git History Report (001)**:
- No commits removed research agent delegation
- Line 684 in current supervise.md shows Task invocation pattern
- Pattern exists but may not be executable

**From Delegation Report (002)**:
- Comparison with `/orchestrate` shows correct pattern: "USE the Task tool NOW"
- `/supervise` uses: "```yaml Task { }```" (documentation block)
- 10 Task patterns found, 0 executable, 10 documentation examples

**From Compliance Report (003)**:
- Orchestrator role definition: Exemplary (lines 7-25)
- Behavioral injection documented correctly (lines 42-110)
- Agent templates reference correct behavioral files

**Synthesis**: The architectural understanding is perfect, but the implementation pattern treats templates as educational content rather than executable instructions. This represents a meta-level regression: the command teaches how to delegate but doesn't actually delegate.

### Theme 3: Standards Compliance with Critical Gaps

**From Git History Report (001)**:
- Phase 1 architecture intact: complexity-based scaling, verification pattern
- Auto-recovery with 50% success threshold
- Verification pattern detailed but unreachable without invocations

**From Delegation Report (002)**:
- Template structure: 934 lines across 8 agent types
- File creation enforcement: Extensive (lines 698-731) but non-functional
- Verification checkpoints: All 6 phases, but unreachable

**From Compliance Report (003)**:
- Strong compliance: Role clarification (100%), command chaining prohibition (100%), path pre-calculation (100%)
- Critical gaps: Metadata extraction (0%), context pruning (0%), forward message pattern (60%)
- Overall compliance: 75-80% weighted score

**Synthesis**: The command demonstrates deep understanding of hierarchical patterns but fails on execution mechanics (imperative invocations) and context optimization (metadata extraction, pruning). It's architecturally sound but operationally non-functional.

## Consolidated Findings

### What Changed (Historical Analysis)

**Commit Timeline**:
1. `4777c49f` (feat(072): Phase 0) - Initial creation with agent delegation foundation
2. `ba8c7c52` - Added auto-recovery to Phase 1 research
3. `efeae236` - Added checkpoint integration
4. `25b1e1ff` (feat(076): Phase 0-2 and 7) - **ONLY CHANGE**: Replaced Phase 0 location-specialist agent with utility functions
5. `6b2a7dcf` (HEAD) - Current state with intact Phase 1 delegation

**Conclusion**: No regression in delegation architecture. Phase 1 research agent templates have been present since initial creation and remain unchanged.

### What's Broken (Current State Analysis)

**Agent Invocation Failure**:
- **Expected**: 9 Task tool invocations across 6 phases
- **Actual**: 0 executable invocations
- **Reason**: All Task patterns wrapped in ```yaml documentation blocks
- **Evidence**: `grep "^Task {" supervise.md` returns 0 matches

**Specific Examples**:

1. **Phase 1 Research** (lines 682-684):
   ```yaml
   # Within code block
   Task {
     description: "Research ${TOPIC_NAME}"
     prompt: "..."
   }
   ```
   **Problem**: No instruction to execute this Task invocation

2. **Phase 2 Planning** (lines 1083-1262):
   Section header: "STEP 2: Invoke plan-architect agent via Task tool"
   **Problem**: Describes the action but doesn't execute it

3. **Overview Synthesis** (lines 986-1003):
   Explicitly commented out:
   ```bash
   # Task {
   #   description: "Synthesize research findings"
   # }
   ```

### What Works (Compliance Strengths)

**Architectural Foundations** (100% Compliant):
- Orchestrator role declaration (lines 7-25): Exceeds standards
- Command chaining prohibition (lines 42-110): Exemplary with side-by-side examples
- Path pre-calculation (lines 379-619): Deterministic, verified, complete
- Agent template structure: References correct behavioral files, complete context injection

**Quality Implementations**:
- Enhanced error reporting with categorization
- Partial failure tolerance (≥50% success threshold)
- Single-retry mechanism for transient failures
- Complexity-based research agent scaling (2-4 agents)

### What's Missing (Critical Gaps)

**Context Optimization** (0% Compliant):
1. **Metadata Extraction**: No calls to `extract_report_metadata()` after verification
   - Impact: Cannot achieve 95% context reduction (5000→250 tokens)
   - Missing: `.claude/lib/metadata-extraction.sh` integration

2. **Context Pruning**: No pruning after phase completion
   - Impact: Cannot achieve <30% context usage target
   - Missing: `.claude/lib/context-pruning.sh` integration

3. **Forward Message Pattern**: Missing structured handoff between phases
   - Impact: 30% efficiency reduction vs standards
   - Missing: Phase transition metadata aggregation

## Prioritized Recommendations

### CRITICAL (Must Fix - Complete Workflow Failure)

#### 1. Convert Documentation Templates to Executable Invocations

**Problem**: All Task invocations exist as YAML documentation, not executable code
**Impact**: 100% workflow failure - command never invokes agents
**Fix Scope**: 9 invocations across 6 phases

**Required Pattern Change**:

**Before (Current - Non-Functional)**:
```markdown
STEP 2: Invoke plan-architect agent via Task tool

```yaml
Task {
  subagent_type: "general-purpose"
  description: "Create implementation plan"
  prompt: "..."
}
```
```

**After (Required - Functional)**:
```markdown
STEP 2: Invoke plan-architect agent via Task tool

**EXECUTE NOW**: USE the Task tool to invoke the plan-architect agent.

Task {
  subagent_type: "general-purpose"
  description: "Create implementation plan with mandatory file creation"
  prompt: "
    Read and follow behavioral guidelines: .claude/agents/plan-architect.md

    **ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENT - Plan File Creation**

    Path: ${PLAN_PATH}
    Research Reports: ${SUCCESSFUL_REPORT_PATHS[@]}

    STEP 1: Create plan file at ${PLAN_PATH} using Write tool FIRST
    STEP 2: Analyze research reports for recommendations
    STEP 3: Develop 3-7 implementation phases using Edit tool
    STEP 4: Return: PLAN_CREATED: ${PLAN_PATH}
  "
}
```

**Affected Sections**:
- Phase 1: Research agents (lines 670-838) - 2-4 invocations
- Phase 1: Overview synthesis (lines 985-1007) - 1 invocation
- Phase 2: Planning (lines 1078-1378) - 1 invocation
- Phase 3: Implementation (lines 1415-1695) - 1 invocation
- Phase 4: Testing (lines 1697-1893) - 1 invocation
- Phase 5: Debug cycle (lines 1894-2213) - 3 invocations
- Phase 6: Documentation (lines 2215-2397) - 1 invocation

**Testing Validation**:
```bash
# Create test: .claude/tests/test_supervise_delegation.sh
IMPERATIVE_INVOCATIONS=$(grep -c 'USE the Task tool\|EXECUTE NOW.*Task' supervise.md)
YAML_BLOCKS=$(grep -c '```yaml.*Task {' supervise.md)

# Pass criteria: ≥9 imperative invocations, 0 YAML blocks with Task
if [ "$IMPERATIVE_INVOCATIONS" -ge 9 ] && [ "$YAML_BLOCKS" -eq 0 ]; then
  echo "✅ PASSED"
fi
```

#### 2. Extract Agent Templates to External Files

**Problem**: supervise.md is 2,521 lines with 934 lines of inline templates (37% bloat)
**Impact**: Maintenance burden, readability issues, violates command architecture standards
**Fix Scope**: 8 template extractions

**Template Files to Create**:
1. `.claude/templates/supervise/research-specialist-template.md` (145 lines)
2. `.claude/templates/supervise/plan-architect-template.md` (180 lines)
3. `.claude/templates/supervise/code-writer-template.md` (177 lines)
4. `.claude/templates/supervise/test-specialist-template.md` (113 lines)
5. `.claude/templates/supervise/debug-analyst-template.md` (93 lines)
6. `.claude/templates/supervise/code-writer-fixes-template.md` (87 lines)
7. `.claude/templates/supervise/test-rerun-template.md` (26 lines)
8. `.claude/templates/supervise/doc-writer-template.md` (113 lines)

**Expected Outcome**: Reduce supervise.md from 2,521 → 1,587 lines (37% reduction)

**Reference Pattern** (from `/orchestrate`):
```markdown
USE the Task tool to invoke the doc-writer agent NOW.

**Agent**: doc-writer
**Behavioral Guidelines**: `.claude/agents/doc-writer.md`
**Template**: `.claude/templates/orchestrate/doc-writer-template.md`
**Context Injection**:
- Summary Path: ${SUMMARY_PATH}
- Artifacts: ${ALL_ARTIFACT_PATHS[@]}
- Workflow Metadata: ${WORKFLOW_DESCRIPTION}
```

### HIGH PRIORITY (Required for Standards Compliance)

#### 3. Implement Metadata Extraction After Verification

**Problem**: Missing metadata extraction prevents 95% context reduction
**Impact**: Context bloat, cannot achieve <30% context usage target
**Fix Location**: Phase 1, after line 878

**Required Change**:
```bash
# After verification passes
if [ -f "$REPORT_PATH" ] && [ -s "$REPORT_PATH" ]; then
  echo "  ✅ PASSED: Report created successfully ($FILE_SIZE bytes)"

  # Extract metadata (95% context reduction: 5000 → 250 tokens)
  source "$SCRIPT_DIR/../lib/metadata-extraction.sh"
  METADATA=$(extract_report_metadata "$REPORT_PATH")

  # Store metadata, not full paths
  REPORT_METADATA+=("$METADATA")
  SUCCESSFUL_REPORT_PATHS+=("$REPORT_PATH")

  # Log context reduction
  METADATA_SIZE=$(echo "$METADATA" | wc -c)
  REDUCTION=$((100 - (METADATA_SIZE * 100 / FILE_SIZE)))
  echo "  Context reduction: ${REDUCTION}%"
fi
```

**Impact**: Achieves 95% context reduction per artifact (5000 → 250 tokens)

#### 4. Add Context Pruning After Phase Completion

**Problem**: No context pruning allows unlimited context accumulation
**Impact**: Exceeds 30% context usage target, performance degradation
**Fix Location**: Phase 1, after line 968

**Required Addition**:
```bash
# Prune research phase context before Phase 2
source "$SCRIPT_DIR/../lib/context-pruning.sh"

# Aggressive pruning for orchestration workflow
apply_pruning_policy --mode aggressive --workflow supervise

# Prune completed research phase
prune_phase_metadata "research"

# Clear full agent outputs (metadata already extracted)
for i in $(seq 1 $SUCCESSFUL_REPORT_COUNT); do
  prune_subagent_output "research_agent_$i"
done

echo "Context pruning complete: Reduced to metadata-only (250 tokens/artifact)"
```

**Impact**: Maintains <30% context usage throughout workflow

#### 5. Implement Forward Message Pattern for Phase Transitions

**Problem**: Missing structured handoff reduces efficiency by 30%
**Impact**: Suboptimal phase transitions, missing handoff logging
**Fix Location**: Phase 1, after line 968

**Required Addition**:
```bash
# Build structured handoff context for Phase 2
source "$SCRIPT_DIR/../lib/metadata-extraction.sh"

RESEARCH_HANDOFF=$(cat <<EOF
{
  "phase_complete": "research",
  "artifacts": [
    $(for metadata in "${REPORT_METADATA[@]}"; do echo "$metadata,"; done | sed '$ s/,$//')
  ],
  "summary": "Research complete. $SUCCESSFUL_REPORT_COUNT reports generated.",
  "next_phase_reads": [
    $(for path in "${SUCCESSFUL_REPORT_PATHS[@]}"; do echo "\"$path\","; done | sed '$ s/,$//')
  ]
}
EOF
)

# Log handoff (not retained in memory after planning)
echo "$RESEARCH_HANDOFF" >> .claude/data/logs/phase-handoffs.log

# Export for Phase 2
export RESEARCH_HANDOFF
```

**Impact**: 90% context reduction vs passing full paths

### MEDIUM PRIORITY (Improved Robustness)

#### 6. Use retry_with_backoff() for Transient Failures

**Problem**: Current retry just rechecks file, doesn't re-invoke agent
**Impact**: False positives for transient failures
**Fix Location**: Line 889

**Recommended Change**:
```bash
source "$SCRIPT_DIR/../lib/error-handling.sh"

# Retry agent invocation with exponential backoff
if retry_with_backoff 2 1000 verify_report_exists "$REPORT_PATH"; then
  echo "  ✅ RETRY SUCCESSFUL"
else
  echo "  ❌ RETRY FAILED"
fi
```

#### 7. Add Regression Test for Delegation Pattern

**Problem**: No automated detection of documentation-only patterns
**Impact**: Future regressions may go undetected
**Test File**: `.claude/tests/test_supervise_delegation.sh`

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Test that supervise.md uses Task tool invocations, not YAML examples

SUPERVISE_FILE=".claude/commands/supervise.md"

# Count imperative Task tool instructions
IMPERATIVE_INVOCATIONS=$(grep -c 'USE the Task tool\|INVOKE.*agent.*NOW' "$SUPERVISE_FILE")

# Count YAML code blocks containing Task
YAML_BLOCKS=$(grep -c '```yaml.*Task {' "$SUPERVISE_FILE")

echo "YAML documentation blocks: $YAML_BLOCKS"
echo "Imperative Task invocations: $IMPERATIVE_INVOCATIONS"

# Validation: Should have 9+ imperative invocations, 0 YAML blocks
if [ "$IMPERATIVE_INVOCATIONS" -ge 9 ] && [ "$YAML_BLOCKS" -eq 0 ]; then
  echo "✅ PASSED: Agent delegation properly implemented"
  exit 0
else
  echo "❌ FAILED: Found $YAML_BLOCKS YAML blocks (expected 0)"
  echo "          Found $IMPERATIVE_INVOCATIONS imperative invocations (expected ≥9)"
  exit 1
fi
```

**Integration**: Add to `.claude/tests/run_all_tests.sh`

### LOW PRIORITY (Documentation and Standards)

#### 8. Update Command Architecture Standards

**Files to Update**:

1. `.claude/docs/concepts/patterns/behavioral-injection.md`:
   - Add "Anti-Pattern: Template Documentation" section
   - Include supervise.md as case study
   - Detection method: YAML blocks vs imperative instructions

2. `.claude/docs/reference/command-architecture-standards.md`:
   - Add Standard 11: "Agent Invocations Must Be Imperative Instructions"
   - Enforcement: Commands must use 'USE Task tool NOW', not '```yaml Task { }```'

3. `.claude/docs/guides/command-development-guide.md`:
   - Section: "Avoiding Documentation-Only Patterns"
   - Before/after examples from supervise.md fix
   - Reference validation test

#### 9. Clarify Phase 0 Optimization in Documentation

**Problem**: Commit `25b1e1ff` message unclear about scope
**Impact**: Confusion that optimization removed all delegation
**Fix**: Update commit message documentation

**Add to supervise.md (lines 379-380)**:
```markdown
## Phase 0: Project Location and Path Pre-Calculation

**OPTIMIZATION NOTE**: This phase previously used location-specialist agent
but was optimized to use utility functions (commit 25b1e1ff, 2025-10-23).
Benefits: 90% context reduction (2000→200 tokens), 20x speed improvement.
Phase 1+ research delegation remains unchanged and uses agent-based approach.
```

## Conclusion

The investigation reveals that the `/supervise` command regression is mischaracterized. The command has **NOT** lost its research delegation capability through code removal. Instead, it suffers from an architectural pattern failure where agent invocation templates were implemented as documentation examples rather than executable instructions.

**The Good News**: All architectural foundations are correct:
- Orchestrator role perfectly defined
- Command chaining properly prohibited
- Path pre-calculation fully implemented
- Agent templates reference correct behavioral files
- Verification checkpoints well-structured

**The Critical Issue**: Execution mechanics broken:
- 0/9 agent invocations executable
- All Task patterns wrapped in YAML documentation blocks
- No imperative instructions to invoke agents
- 100% workflow failure rate

**The Path Forward**:
1. Convert documentation templates to imperative invocations (Critical - Week 1)
2. Extract templates to external files (Critical - Week 1-2)
3. Add metadata extraction and context pruning (High Priority - Week 2)
4. Implement regression testing (Medium Priority - Week 2-3)
5. Update standards documentation (Low Priority - Week 3)

**Expected Outcome**: Full restoration of workflow functionality with 100% agent delegation rate, <30% context usage, and 95%+ standards compliance.

The Phase 0 optimization (location-specialist agent → utility functions) was successful and should be retained. It demonstrates the correct pattern for optimizing deterministic operations while preserving agent delegation for complex reasoning tasks.
