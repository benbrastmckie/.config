# Supervise Command Git History Analysis

## Research Metadata
- **Topic**: Supervise Git History Analysis
- **Created**: 2025-10-23
- **Status**: Complete

## Executive Summary

**CRITICAL FINDING**: The /supervise command **STILL DELEGATES** to research subagents in Phase 1. The command architecture has NOT regressed.

**ACTUAL REGRESSION**: Only the **location-specialist agent** in Phase 0 was replaced with utility functions in commit `25b1e1ff` (2025-10-23). This was an **optimization**, not a regression - reducing context by 85-95% and improving speed by 20x.

**Phase 1 Research Agents**: Fully intact and functional (lines 621-875 in current supervise.md).

## Research Objective
Identify when the /supervise command stopped delegating to research subagents by analyzing git history.

## Methodology
1. Analyzed git log for `.claude/commands/supervise.md` (19 commits since initial creation)
2. Searched for commits modifying agent delegation behavior
3. Examined diffs between critical commits (4777c49f → 25b1e1ff → HEAD)
4. Verified current Phase 1 implementation in live file

## Findings

### Key Commit Timeline

**Initial Creation (4777c49f - feat(072): Phase 0)**
- Created `/supervise` foundation with agent delegation architecture
- Phase 0: location-specialist agent for path calculation
- Phase 1: 2-4 parallel research agents via Task tool
- Pattern: Orchestrator delegates, never executes

**Optimization (25b1e1ff - feat(076): Phase 0-2 and 7)**
- **ONLY CHANGE**: Replaced location-specialist agent with utility functions
- Phase 0 now uses: `topic-utils.sh`, `detect-project-dir.sh`
- **Benefits**: 85-95% token reduction, 20x+ speedup
- **Phase 1 unchanged**: Research agents still delegated via Task tool

**Current State (HEAD - 6b2a7dcf)**
- Phase 1 research delegation: **FULLY INTACT**
- Lines 621-875: Complete research agent invocation template
- Pattern: Invoke 2-4 research specialists in parallel
- Each agent receives: behavioral guidelines (research-specialist.md), report path, workflow description
- Verification: Mandatory file creation checks after agent completion

### Phase 1 Architecture (Current)

**Agent Invocation Pattern** (lines 670-830):
```yaml
Task {
  subagent_type: "general-purpose"
  description: "Research ${TOPIC_NAME} with mandatory file creation"
  prompt: "
    Read and follow behavioral guidelines: .claude/agents/research-specialist.md

    STEP 1: Create report file at ${REPORT_PATHS[i]}
    STEP 2: Conduct research (codebase, docs, best practices)
    STEP 3: Populate report with findings
    STEP 4: Return REPORT_CREATED confirmation
  "
}
```

**Complexity-Based Scaling** (lines 645-668):
- Default: 2 research topics
- Complex keywords (integrate, migration, refactor): 3 topics
- Very complex (multi-system, distributed): 4 topics
- Simple workflows (fix, update single): 1 topic

**Verification Pattern** (lines 840-875):
- Mandatory file existence checks
- File size validation (>200 bytes expected)
- Quality checks (markdown headers, sections)
- Auto-recovery with single retry for transient failures
- 50% success threshold (continue if ≥50% agents succeed)

## Critical Changes Identified

### Commit 25b1e1ff (2025-10-23)
**Title**: feat(076): Phase 0-2 and 7 - Optimize /supervise location detection

**Changed Section**: Phase 0 - Project Location Detection

**Before** (location-specialist agent):
```yaml
Task {
  subagent_type: "general-purpose"
  description: "Determine project location for workflow"
  prompt: "
    Read behavioral guidelines: .claude/agents/location-specialist.md
    Workflow Description: ${WORKFLOW_DESCRIPTION}

    Determine the appropriate location using the deepest directory
    that encompasses the workflow scope.

    Return ONLY these exact lines:
    LOCATION: <path>
    TOPIC_NUMBER: <NNN>
    TOPIC_NAME: <snake_case_name>
  "
}
```

**After** (utility functions):
```bash
# Source utility libraries
SCRIPT_DIR="$(cd "$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")" && pwd)"

if [ -f "$SCRIPT_DIR/../lib/topic-utils.sh" ]; then
  source "$SCRIPT_DIR/../lib/topic-utils.sh"
else
  echo "ERROR: topic-utils.sh not found"
  echo "Falling back to location-specialist agent..."
  exit 1
fi

if [ -f "$SCRIPT_DIR/../lib/detect-project-dir.sh" ]; then
  source "$SCRIPT_DIR/../lib/detect-project-dir.sh"
else
  echo "ERROR: detect-project-dir.sh not found"
  exit 1
fi

# Calculate location metadata
PROJECT_ROOT=$(detect_project_root)
SPECS_DIR="${PROJECT_ROOT}/.claude/specs"
TOPIC_NUM=$(get_next_topic_number "$SPECS_DIR")
TOPIC_NAME=$(sanitize_topic_name "$WORKFLOW_DESCRIPTION")
```

**Impact**:
- Context reduction: ~2000 tokens → ~200 tokens (90% reduction)
- Speed improvement: ~3-5s agent call → ~50ms utility execution (20x faster)
- Determinism: Agent-based → rule-based (more reliable)
- **Phase 1 unchanged**: Research agents still fully delegated

### No Other Regression Commits Found

Exhaustive analysis of all 19 commits shows:
- **NO removal** of research agent delegation in Phase 1
- **NO changes** to Task tool invocation pattern
- **NO modifications** to research-specialist.md behavioral guidelines
- **ONLY change**: Phase 0 location detection optimization

## Conclusion

**The /supervise command has NOT stopped delegating to research subagents.**

The misconception likely stems from:
1. **Confusion**: Phase 0 location-specialist removal misinterpreted as broader agent removal
2. **Documentation**: Commit message "optimize location detection" didn't clarify scope
3. **Behavioral observation**: If research agents aren't working, it's due to:
   - Research-specialist.md behavioral issues (not invocation issues)
   - Agent execution failures (not delegation failures)
   - Path calculation errors in Phase 0 utilities (preventing Phase 1)

**Evidence of Intact Delegation**:
- Line 14: `3. Invoke specialized agents via Task tool with complete context injection`
- Line 684: `Task { subagent_type: "general-purpose" description: "Research ${TOPIC_NAME}..."`
- Line 688: `Read and follow behavioral guidelines: .claude/agents/research-specialist.md`
- Lines 840-920: Complete verification and auto-recovery for research agents

**What Changed**: Phase 0 location detection (agent → utility)
**What Didn't Change**: Phase 1 research delegation (still uses agents)
**Performance Benefit**: 90% context reduction in Phase 0, no Phase 1 impact

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions

1. **Clarify Documentation** (Priority: HIGH)
   - Update commit message for 25b1e1ff with clearer scope
   - Add comment in supervise.md Phase 0 noting optimization history
   - Document that Phase 1 research delegation unchanged

2. **Investigate Actual Issue** (Priority: CRITICAL)
   - If research agents aren't working, root cause is NOT in supervise.md
   - Check: `.claude/agents/research-specialist.md` for behavioral issues
   - Check: Phase 0 utility execution for path calculation errors
   - Check: Checkpoint/resume logic for skipping Phase 1 incorrectly

3. **Add Regression Tests** (Priority: MEDIUM)
   - Test case: Verify Phase 1 invokes Task tool with research-specialist.md
   - Test case: Verify 2-4 research reports created for different complexities
   - Test case: Verify fallback triggers when agent creation fails
   - Location: `.claude/tests/test_supervise_research_delegation.sh`

### Future Optimizations

1. **Consider Research Agent Optimization** (If needed)
   - IF research agents are slow/unreliable: Consider hybrid approach
   - Option A: Use utilities for simple research (keyword search)
   - Option B: Use agents only for complex analysis (>3 topics)
   - Benchmark: Current agent approach vs utility-based research

2. **Enhance Error Reporting** (Phase 1)
   - Current: Generic "agent failed" messages
   - Improved: Categorize failures (file creation, research quality, verification)
   - Add: Structured error output from research-specialist.md

3. **Document Optimization Pattern** (General)
   - Create guide: "When to Replace Agents with Utilities"
   - Criteria: Deterministic tasks, high-frequency operations, simple logic
   - Examples: Location detection (replaced), research (keep agents), planning (keep agents)
