- **Structure Level**: 0
- **Complexity Score**: 42.5
- **Research Reports**:

## Overview

The /coordinate command is currently production-ready at 1,859 lines, well within the 2,500-3,000 line target range, and demonstrates strong architectural compliance with orchestration best practices. This refactor focuses on incremental efficiency improvements that enhance maintainability and clarity without altering the proven working functionality.

**Key Objectives**:
1. Add documentation markers for clear extraction vs retention guidance
2. Enhance library inline documentation for maintainability
3. Consolidate duplicate documentation via cross-references
4. Optimize reference content organization
5. Preserve 100% of execution-critical patterns

**Anti-Goals**:
- NOT changing behavioral patterns that are working (wave-based execution, fail-fast error handling)
- NOT extracting execution-critical inline templates (agent invocations, verification helpers)
- NOT introducing breaking changes to the orchestration flow
- NOT pursuing aggressive file size reduction (current size is acceptable)

## Research Summary

Based on comprehensive analysis of the /coordinate implementation and orchestration best practices:

**Architecture Analysis Findings** (Report 001):
- Command demonstrates mature library integration with 8 specialized utilities
- Successfully achieves <30% context usage through aggressive pruning
- Wave-based parallel execution delivers 40-60% time savings
- 100% file creation reliability through fail-fast verification
- Current size (1,859 lines) is within recommended range

**Best Practices Alignment** (Report 002):
- Phase 0 path pre-calculation: Fully implemented (85% token reduction achieved)
- Behavioral injection pattern: 100% compliance across all 8 agent invocations
- Fail-fast error handling: Consistent 5-component diagnostic structure
- Concise verification formatting: 90% token reduction on success paths
- Library silence pattern: Successfully implemented in workflow-initialization.sh

**Gap Analysis** (Report 003):
- **Primary Opportunity**: Add documentation markers ([REFERENCE-OK], [EXECUTION-CRITICAL]) for clarity
- **Secondary Opportunity**: Enhance workflow-initialization.sh inline comments (currently 1.6% comment density vs 10-20% industry standard)
- **Tertiary Opportunity**: Consolidate 60-80 lines of duplicate documentation via cross-references
- **Deferred**: Reference extraction (165 lines) provides marginal benefit given current file size

**Recommended Approach**: Implement P0-P2 improvements (documentation markers, library inline docs, duplicate consolidation) for 85% of value at 40% of effort. Defer reference extraction until command grows beyond 3,000 lines.

## Success Criteria

- [x] All major sections in coordinate.md have documentation markers ([REFERENCE-OK] or [EXECUTION-CRITICAL])
- [x] workflow-initialization.sh has inline comments explaining design decisions (target 10% comment density)
- [x] Duplicate documentation consolidated via cross-references (60-80 line reduction)
- [x] Zero functional regressions (all verification patterns preserved)
- [x] File creation reliability remains 100%
- [x] Context usage remains <30% throughout workflow
- [x] All tests pass (orchestration command tests, library tests)
- [x] Git commit per phase following project standards

## Technical Design

### Architecture Preservation

**Core Principles** (MUST NOT CHANGE):
1. Pure orchestration architecture (Task tool only for agent invocations)
2. Behavioral injection pattern (explicit context injection, no SlashCommand usage)
3. Fail-fast error handling with 5-component diagnostics
4. Wave-based parallel execution via dependency-analyzer.sh
5. Concise verification formatting (silent success, verbose failure)
6. Library silence pattern (calculations silent, commands communicate)

**Execution-Critical Sections** (MUST REMAIN INLINE):
1. Phase 0-6 implementation blocks (lines 508-1708 in current file)
2. Verification helper functions (verify_file_created and similar)
3. Agent invocation templates (8 EXECUTE NOW blocks with complete Task syntax)
4. Error message examples demonstrating 5-component structure
5. Critical warnings (NEVER/MUST/CRITICAL blocks)

### Optimization Strategy

**Phase 1**: Documentation Markers (Low-Risk, High-Clarity)
- Add [REFERENCE-OK] tags to 6 extractable sections
- Add [EXECUTION-CRITICAL] tags to 8 core execution sections
- Zero functional impact, pure documentation change

**Phase 2**: Library Inline Documentation (Low-Risk, High-Maintainability)
- Add inline comments to workflow-initialization.sh (30-40 lines)
- Document: silent operation principle, fail-fast philosophy, array export workaround, path pre-calculation rationale
- Comments are non-executable, cannot break functionality

**Phase 3**: Duplicate Consolidation (Low-Risk, Maintenance Win)
- Replace 60-80 lines of duplicate content with cross-references
- Targets: utility functions table, error message format, progress marker format
- Maintains content availability via links to authoritative sources

**Phase 4**: Reference Organization (Medium-Risk, Moderate-Benefit)
- Optional extraction of 165 lines of reference content to external docs
- Only if Phase 1-3 indicate additional optimization needed
- Verification testing required after extraction

**Phase 5**: Validation and Testing
- Run full orchestration test suite
- Verify /coordinate through complete workflow cycle
- Confirm context usage metrics unchanged
- Document improvements and performance impact
