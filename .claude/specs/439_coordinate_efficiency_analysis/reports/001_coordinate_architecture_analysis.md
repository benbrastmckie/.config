# /coordinate Command Architecture Analysis

## Metadata
- **Date**: 2025-10-29
- **Agent**: research-specialist
- **Topic**: Analysis of /coordinate command architecture and implementation patterns
- **Report Type**: codebase analysis
- **Command File**: /home/benjamin/.config/.claude/commands/coordinate.md
- **File Size**: ~2,500-3,000 lines (estimated based on line count)

## Executive Summary

The /coordinate command represents a production-ready orchestration system that achieves 40-60% time savings through wave-based parallel execution while maintaining <30% context usage. The architecture demonstrates mature library integration with 8 specialized utility libraries and 6 dedicated agent behavioral files, implementing fail-fast error handling with comprehensive diagnostics, and supporting 4 distinct workflow types (research-only, research-and-plan, full-implementation, debug-only). The command integrates 225+ lines of Phase 0 initialization into a single function call (workflow-initialization.sh), uses dependency graph analysis via Kahn's algorithm for wave calculation, and maintains architectural purity through behavioral injection rather than command chaining.

## Findings

### 1. Command Structure and Organization (Lines 1-1860)

**File Size**: Approximately 2,500-3,000 lines
- Phase 0: Lines 508-743 (235 lines - library sourcing + path pre-calculation)
- Phase 1: Lines 811-1008 (197 lines - research with parallel agents)
- Phase 2: Lines 1010-1180 (170 lines - planning)
- Phase 3: Lines 1182-1356 (174 lines - wave-based implementation)
- Phase 4: Lines 1358-1459 (101 lines - testing)
- Phase 5: Lines 1461-1617 (156 lines - debug with iteration loop)
- Phase 6: Lines 1619-1695 (76 lines - documentation)
- Supporting sections: ~1,500 lines (documentation, examples, utilities)

**Organizational Pattern**:
- Header metadata (lines 1-7): Command registration, allowed tools, description
- Role clarification (lines 11-66): Orchestrator responsibilities, prohibited actions
- Architectural prohibition (lines 68-132): No command chaining, direct agent invocation only
- Workflow overview (lines 134-276): 7-phase structure with wave-based execution
- Library integration (lines 318-360): 8 required libraries with fail-fast verification
- Phase implementations (lines 508-1695): Sequential phase execution blocks
- Agent behavioral files (lines 1710-1752): 6 specialized agents referenced
- Usage examples (lines 1754-1805): 4 workflow types demonstrated

**Key Architectural Decision**: Separation of orchestrator role from executor role is enforced through tool restrictions (Task/TodoWrite/Bash/Read only, no Write/Edit/Grep/Glob).

### 2. Library Integration Approach

**8 Required Libraries** (lines 319-330):
1. `workflow-detection.sh` - Workflow scope detection (4 types), phase execution control
2. `error-handling.sh` - Error classification, diagnostic generation, retry logic
3. `checkpoint-utils.sh` - Resume capability, state management
4. `unified-logger.sh` - Progress tracking, event logging
5. `unified-location-detection.sh` - Topic directory structure creation
6. `metadata-extraction.sh` - Context reduction (80-90% savings)
7. `context-pruning.sh` - Aggressive context optimization between phases
8. `dependency-analyzer.sh` - Wave calculation via Kahn's algorithm (634 lines)

**Integration Pattern** (Phase 0 STEP 0, lines 522-603):
```bash
# Single consolidated call replaces 225+ lines of inline logic
if ! initialize_workflow_paths "$WORKFLOW_DESCRIPTION" "$WORKFLOW_SCOPE"; then
  echo "ERROR: Workflow initialization failed"
  exit 1
fi
```

**Token Reduction**: Phase 0 optimization achieves 85% token reduction by pre-calculating all paths upfront rather than using agent-based detection (from /research optimization analysis).

**Library Sourcing Verification** (lines 522-568):
- Automatic verification of 12 required functions after library loading
- Fail-fast on missing functions with clear diagnostic output
- Inline definition of `display_brief_summary()` function (lines 569-600)

### 3. Phase Execution Patterns

**Phase 0: Location and Path Pre-Calculation** (lines 508-743)
- Pattern: Library sourcing → utility-based location detection → directory creation → path export
- Consolidation: workflow-initialization.sh reduces 350+ lines to ~100 lines
- Critical requirement: ALL paths calculated before Phase 1 begins
- Exports 15+ variables: LOCATION, SPECS_ROOT, TOPIC_NUM, TOPIC_PATH, PLAN_PATH, etc.
- Array handling: REPORT_PATHS array exported via count + individual variables (bash limitation workaround)

**Phase 1: Research** (lines 811-1008)
- Complexity-based research topics (1-4 agents based on workflow keywords)
- Parallel agent invocation via Task tool in single message
- Verification pattern: `verify_file_created()` with concise output (✓ per file)
- Partial failure handling: ≥50% success threshold allows continuation
- Conditional overview synthesis: Only for research-only workflows (planning synthesizes otherwise)
- Context pruning: Store metadata, retain full reports for planning phase

**Phase 2: Planning** (lines 1010-1180)
- Agent: plan-architect.md (behavioral injection pattern)
- Input: Research reports list + standards file + workflow description
- Verification: Plan file + structure validation (≥3 phases, metadata section)
- Metadata extraction: Phase count, complexity, estimated time
- Workflow completion check: Exits after Phase 2 for research-and-plan workflows

**Phase 3: Wave-Based Implementation** (lines 1182-1356)
- Dependency analysis: `analyze_dependencies()` from dependency-analyzer.sh
- Wave calculation: Kahn's algorithm for topological sorting
- Wave structure display: Shows phases per wave with parallel/sequential flags
- Agent: implementer-coordinator.md (orchestrates wave execution)
- Sub-agents: implementation-executor.md (one per phase within wave)
- Metrics tracking: Waves completed, phases completed, parallel phases, time saved %
- Context pruning: Aggressive pruning of wave metadata after completion

**Phase 4: Testing** (lines 1358-1459)
- Agent: test-specialist.md (executes test suite)
- Output parsing: TEST_STATUS, TESTS_TOTAL, TESTS_PASSED, TESTS_FAILED
- Phase 5 trigger: Test failures enable debugging phase
- Context management: Test output retained for potential debugging

**Phase 5: Debug** (lines 1461-1617)
- Execution condition: Tests failed OR workflow is debug-only
- Iteration loop: Max 3 debug cycles (analyze → fix → retest)
- Agent sequence: debug-analyst.md → code-writer.md → test-specialist.md
- Exit condition: Tests pass OR 3 iterations exhausted
- Warning on failure: Manual intervention required message

**Phase 6: Documentation** (lines 1619-1695)
- Execution condition: Implementation occurred (Phase 3 ran)
- Agent: doc-writer.md (creates workflow summary)
- Input: All artifacts (plan, reports, implementation, test results)
- Final context pruning: Clean up all workflow metadata

### 4. Agent Delegation Mechanisms

**6 Specialized Agents** (lines 1710-1752):
1. `research-specialist.md` - Research with mandatory file creation (15,484 bytes)
2. `plan-architect.md` - Implementation planning (size not checked)
3. `implementer-coordinator.md` - Wave orchestration (size not checked)
4. `implementation-executor.md` - Individual phase execution (18,414 bytes)
5. `test-specialist.md` - Test execution (size not checked)
6. `debug-analyst.md` - Root cause analysis (12,374 bytes)
7. `code-writer.md` - Fix application (18,988 bytes)
8. `doc-writer.md` - Summary creation (21,777 bytes)

**Behavioral Injection Pattern** (lines 87-103, standard template):
```markdown
Task {
  subagent_type: "general-purpose"
  description: "Brief task description"
  prompt: |
    Read and follow ALL behavioral guidelines from: .claude/agents/[agent-name].md

    **Workflow-Specific Context**:
    - [Pre-calculated paths and parameters]

    Execute following all guidelines.
    Return: [SIGNAL]: [artifact_path]
}
```

**Key Benefits of Behavioral Injection**:
- Lean context: ~200 lines (agent guidelines) vs ~2,000 lines (full command prompt)
- Behavioral control: Custom instructions per invocation
- Structured output: Metadata format (path, status) not full summaries
- Verification points: Explicit checkpoints after file creation
- Path control: Orchestrator pre-calculates, agent receives absolute path

**Anti-Pattern: Command Chaining** (lines 68-132):
The command explicitly prohibits `SlashCommand` tool usage for /plan, /implement, /debug invocations. This prevents context bloat (2,000 lines per command), broken behavioral injection, and loss of verification control.

### 5. Verification and Error Handling Patterns

**Verification Helper Function** (lines 752-809):
```bash
verify_file_created() {
  local file_path="$1"
  local item_desc="$2"
  local phase_name="$3"

  if [ -f "$file_path" ] && [ -s "$file_path" ]; then
    echo -n "✓"  # Success - single character
    return 0
  else
    # Multi-line diagnostic with directory status, file count, commands
    return 1
  fi
}
```

**Concise Verification Pattern**:
- Success: Single ✓ character (no newline)
- Failure: Verbose diagnostic with directory status, suggested commands
- Used in: Phase 1 research reports, Phase 2 plan, Phase 6 summary

**Fail-Fast Error Handling** (lines 269-315):
- Philosophy: "One clear execution path, fail fast with full context"
- NO retries: Single execution attempt per operation
- NO fallbacks: Report why and exit (except Phase 1 partial failure)
- Clear diagnostics: Every error shows what failed, why, and debugging steps
- Partial research success: ≥50% of parallel agents must succeed (Phase 1 only)

**Error Message Structure** (lines 289-311):
```
❌ ERROR: [What failed]
   Expected: [What was supposed to happen]
   Found: [What actually happened]

DIAGNOSTIC INFORMATION:
  - [Specific check that failed]
  - [File system state or error details]

What to check next:
  1. [Debugging step]
  2. [Debugging step]

Example commands:
  ls -la [path]
  cat [file]
```

**Library: error-handling.sh** (765 lines):
- Error classification: transient, permanent, fatal
- Error type detection: syntax, test_failure, file_not_found, timeout, etc.
- Location extraction: Parse file:line from error messages
- Suggestion generation: Context-specific recovery guidance
- Retry metadata: Extended timeout calculation, fallback toolset

### 6. Context Management and Pruning Strategies

**Context Pruning Approach** (library: context-pruning.sh, 441 lines):

**Metadata-Only Passing**:
- Extract artifact paths + 50-word summary from agent outputs
- Store in associative arrays: PRUNED_METADATA_CACHE, PHASE_METADATA_CACHE
- 80-90% context reduction per phase

**Workflow-Specific Pruning Policies** (lines 371-423):
- `plan_creation`: Prune research after planning completes
- `orchestrate`: Prune research+planning after implementation
- `implement`: Prune previous phase research after each phase

**Progressive Pruning** (applied across phases):
- Phase 1: Store metadata, keep reports for planning
- Phase 2: Prune research for plan-only workflows
- Phase 3: Aggressive pruning of wave metadata, prune research/planning
- Phase 4: Retain test output for debugging
- Phase 5: Prune test output after debugging complete
- Phase 6: Final cleanup, <30% context usage

**Context Size Reporting**:
```bash
get_current_context_size()  # Sum of all cached metadata
report_context_savings()    # Calculate % reduction
```

**Target**: <30% context usage throughout workflow (achieved via aggressive pruning)

### 7. Wave-Based Parallel Execution

**Dependency Analysis** (library: dependency-analyzer.sh, 639 lines):

**Core Algorithm**: Kahn's algorithm for topological sorting
1. Parse phase dependencies from plan files: `depends_on: [phase_1, phase_2]`
2. Build dependency graph: nodes (phases) + edges (dependencies)
3. Calculate in-degree: Count incoming edges per node
4. Group into waves: All phases with in-degree 0 → Wave 1, then reduce in-degrees
5. Repeat: Continue until all phases assigned to waves

**Wave Execution Pattern** (lines 1206-1248):
```markdown
Wave 1: [Phase 1, Phase 2]          ← 2 phases in parallel (0 dependencies)
Wave 2: [Phase 3, Phase 4, Phase 5] ← 3 phases in parallel (depend on Wave 1)
Wave 3: [Phase 6, Phase 7]          ← 2 phases in parallel (depend on Waves 1-2)
Wave 4: [Phase 8]                   ← 1 phase (depends on Wave 3)

Time Savings: 50% (8 phases → 4 waves)
```

**Performance Impact** (lines 236-240):
- Best case: 60% time savings (many independent phases)
- Typical case: 40-50% time savings (moderate dependencies)
- Worst case: 0% savings (fully sequential dependencies)

**Implementation** (Phase 3):
- Implementer-coordinator agent receives wave structure + dependency graph
- Spawns implementation-executor agents in parallel (one per phase in wave)
- Waits for all phases in wave before proceeding to next wave
- Tracks: waves completed, phases completed, parallel phases executed, time saved %

**Cycle Detection** (lines 397-474):
- DFS-based cycle detection before wave calculation
- Returns error if circular dependency found
- Prevents infinite loops in wave execution

### 8. Workflow Scope Detection

**4 Workflow Types** (library: workflow-detection.sh, lines 1-130):

1. **research-only** (lines 46-56):
   - Keywords: "research [topic]" without "plan" or "implement"
   - Phases: 0, 1
   - No plan, no summary

2. **research-and-plan** (lines 58-64, MOST COMMON):
   - Keywords: "research...to create plan", "analyze...for planning"
   - Phases: 0, 1, 2
   - Creates reports + plan, no implementation

3. **full-implementation** (lines 66-72):
   - Keywords: "implement", "build", "add feature"
   - Phases: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6
   - Phase 5 conditional on test failures

4. **debug-only** (lines 74-80):
   - Keywords: "fix [bug]", "debug [issue]"
   - Phases: 0, 1, 5
   - No new plan or implementation

**Scope Detection Logic** (lines 46-84):
- Regex pattern matching on workflow description
- Priority order: research-only → research-and-plan → full-implementation → debug-only
- Fallback: Conservative default to research-and-plan

**Phase Execution Control** (lines 95-111):
```bash
should_run_phase() {
  local phase_num="$1"
  if echo "$PHASES_TO_EXECUTE" | grep -q "$phase_num"; then
    return 0  # Execute phase
  else
    return 1  # Skip phase
  fi
}
```

**Usage in Phases**:
```bash
should_run_phase 3 || {
  echo "⏭️  Skipping Phase 3 (Implementation)"
  echo "  Reason: Workflow type is $WORKFLOW_SCOPE"
  exit 0
}
```

### 9. Redundant Code and Optimization Opportunities

**Inline Helper Function** (lines 569-600):
`display_brief_summary()` defined inline in Phase 0 STEP 0. Could be moved to library for reuse across orchestration commands.

**Array Export Workaround** (lines 286-292):
Bash limitation requires exporting array via count + individual variables:
```bash
export REPORT_PATHS_COUNT="${#report_paths[@]}"
for i in "${!report_paths[@]}"; do
  export "REPORT_PATH_$i=${report_paths[$i]}"
done
```
Then reconstructing: `reconstruct_report_paths_array()` (lines 307-319)

This is necessary due to bash limitations, not redundant code.

**Verification Function Export** (line 808):
`export -f verify_file_created` ensures function available in subshells. Pattern repeated across library files for consistency.

**Progress Markers** (multiple locations):
`emit_progress()` calls appear at every phase transition. This is intentional for external monitoring, not redundant.

**Overview Synthesis Conditionals** (lines 936-984):
Complex logic for determining when to create OVERVIEW.md. Uses helper functions:
- `should_synthesize_overview()` - Decision logic
- `calculate_overview_path()` - Path generation
- `get_synthesis_skip_reason()` - Explanation message

This could be consolidated but represents valid architectural separation.

**Checkpoint Save Blocks** (multiple locations):
Each phase saves checkpoint with JSON structure. Pattern is repetitive but intentional for resumability:
```bash
ARTIFACT_PATHS_JSON=$(cat <<EOF
{
  "research_reports": [...]
  "plan_path": "$PLAN_PATH"
  ...
}
EOF
)
save_checkpoint "coordinate" "phase_N" "$ARTIFACT_PATHS_JSON"
```

### 10. Repetitive Patterns

**Phase Execution Check** (repeated in every phase):
```bash
should_run_phase N || {
  echo "⏭️  Skipping Phase N (Name)"
  echo "  Reason: Workflow type is $WORKFLOW_SCOPE"
  exit 0
}
```
This pattern appears at the start of Phases 1-6 with minimal variation.

**Agent Invocation Template** (repeated for each agent):
```markdown
**EXECUTE NOW**: USE the Task tool with these parameters:
- subagent_type: "general-purpose"
- description: "[task description]"
- prompt: |
    Read and follow ALL behavioral guidelines from: [agent-path]

    **Workflow-Specific Context**: [parameters]

    Execute following all guidelines.
    Return: [SIGNAL]: [path]
```

This pattern appears 6+ times (one per agent invocation) with context-specific variations.

**Verification Pattern** (repeated after each agent):
```bash
echo -n "Verifying [artifact]: "
if verify_file_created "$PATH" "[description]" "Phase N"; then
  echo " (metadata)"
  emit_progress "N" "Verified: [description]"
else
  echo ""
  echo "Workflow TERMINATED: Fix [issue] and retry"
  exit 1
fi
```

This appears after every file-creating agent invocation with variations in metadata extraction.

**Context Pruning Blocks** (repeated at end of each phase):
```bash
store_phase_metadata "phase_N" "complete" "$ARTIFACTS"
apply_pruning_policy "phase_name" "$WORKFLOW_SCOPE"
echo "Phase N metadata stored (context reduction: 80-90%)"
emit_progress "N" "Phase complete"
```

### 11. High Complexity Areas

**Phase 0 STEP 0: Library Sourcing** (lines 522-603, ~80 lines):
- Complexity: Medium-High
- Function verification loop (12 required functions)
- Inline definition of `display_brief_summary()` (nested case statement)
- Multiple conditional paths for workflow types

**Phase 1: Research Overview Synthesis** (lines 936-1007, ~70 lines):
- Complexity: High
- Conditional synthesis decision (research-only vs other workflows)
- Overview path calculation
- Report list building loop
- Agent invocation with dynamic context
- Verification + context pruning

**Phase 3: Wave-Based Implementation** (lines 1182-1356, ~174 lines):
- Complexity: Very High
- Dependency analysis with error handling
- Wave structure parsing (JSON manipulation)
- Display loop for wave visualization
- Implementer-coordinator agent invocation with complex context
- Metrics extraction (6+ variables from agent output)
- Implementation artifacts verification
- Checkpoint saving with nested JSON structure

**Phase 5: Debug Iteration Loop** (lines 1461-1617, ~156 lines):
- Complexity: High
- For loop with max 3 iterations
- 3 sequential agent invocations per iteration (debug-analyst → code-writer → test-specialist)
- Agent output parsing repeated 3 times
- Test status tracking across iterations
- Early exit condition on test pass

## Recommendations

### 1. Extract Repetitive Patterns to Library Functions

**Recommended Refactoring**:
Create `orchestration-patterns.sh` library with reusable functions:

```bash
# Phase execution guard
check_phase_execution() {
  local phase_num="$1"
  local phase_name="$2"
  should_run_phase "$phase_num" || {
    echo "⏭️  Skipping Phase $phase_num ($phase_name)"
    echo "  Reason: Workflow type is $WORKFLOW_SCOPE"
    display_brief_summary
    exit 0
  }
}

# Standard verification pattern
verify_and_report() {
  local artifact_path="$1"
  local description="$2"
  local phase_num="$3"

  echo -n "Verifying $description: "
  if verify_file_created "$artifact_path" "$description" "Phase $phase_num"; then
    echo ""
    emit_progress "$phase_num" "Verified: $description"
    return 0
  else
    echo ""
    echo "Workflow TERMINATED: Fix verification failure and retry"
    exit 1
  fi
}

# Phase completion pattern
complete_phase() {
  local phase_num="$1"
  local phase_name="$2"
  local artifacts="$3"

  store_phase_metadata "phase_$phase_num" "complete" "$artifacts"
  apply_pruning_policy "$phase_name" "$WORKFLOW_SCOPE"
  emit_progress "$phase_num" "$phase_name complete"
}
```

**Impact**: Reduce command file by ~200-300 lines (8-12% reduction)

### 2. Consolidate Agent Invocation Templates

**Current State**: Each agent invocation is a separate markdown block with inline Task parameters.

**Recommended Approach**: Create agent invocation helper:

```bash
invoke_agent() {
  local agent_name="$1"
  local description="$2"
  local context_json="$3"  # JSON object with all context parameters

  # Build prompt from template with context substitution
  local prompt=$(generate_agent_prompt "$agent_name" "$context_json")

  # Return Task invocation markdown (for copy-paste by orchestrator)
  cat <<EOF
**EXECUTE NOW**: USE the Task tool with these parameters:
- subagent_type: "general-purpose"
- description: "$description"
- prompt: |
$prompt
EOF
}
```

**Impact**: Centralize agent invocation logic, reduce repetition by ~100-150 lines

### 3. Create Checkpoint Utility Function

**Current State**: Each phase builds checkpoint JSON inline with heredoc.

**Recommended Function**:
```bash
save_phase_checkpoint() {
  local phase_num="$1"
  local checkpoint_data="$2"  # JSON string or associative array

  # Build standardized checkpoint structure
  local checkpoint_json=$(jq -n \
    --argjson phase "$phase_num" \
    --argjson data "$checkpoint_data" \
    '{
      phase: $phase,
      timestamp: now | strftime("%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ"),
      data: $data
    }')

  save_checkpoint "coordinate" "phase_$phase_num" "$checkpoint_json"
}
```

**Impact**: Reduce checkpoint code by ~50-80 lines, improve consistency

### 4. Move `display_brief_summary()` to Library

**Current State**: Function defined inline in Phase 0 STEP 0 (lines 569-600)

**Recommended Location**: `workflow-initialization.sh` or new `workflow-completion.sh`

**Benefits**:
- Reusable across orchestration commands (/coordinate, /orchestrate, /supervise)
- Easier to maintain single source of truth
- Reduces coordinate.md by ~30 lines

### 5. Simplify Wave Visualization Logic

**Current State**: Phase 3 contains inline loop for displaying wave structure (lines 1235-1247)

**Recommended Helper** (in dependency-analyzer.sh):
```bash
display_wave_plan() {
  local waves_json="$1"

  echo "$waves_json" | jq -r '.[] |
    "  Wave \(.wave_number): \(.phases | length) phase(s) " +
    (if .can_parallel then "[PARALLEL]" else "[SEQUENTIAL]" end) +
    "\n" + (.phases[] | "    - Phase \(.)")'
}
```

**Impact**: Simplify Phase 3 by ~15 lines, improve readability

### 6. Extract Overview Synthesis Decision Logic

**Current State**: Complex conditional logic in Phase 1 (lines 936-984)

**Recommended Library Addition** (overview-synthesis.sh):
```bash
should_synthesize_overview()  # Already exists
calculate_overview_path()     # Already exists
get_synthesis_skip_reason()   # Already exists

# New: Consolidated synthesis orchestration
handle_research_overview() {
  local workflow_scope="$1"
  local research_subdir="$2"
  local successful_report_paths=("${@:3}")

  if ! should_synthesize_overview "$workflow_scope" "${#successful_report_paths[@]}"; then
    local reason=$(get_synthesis_skip_reason "$workflow_scope" "${#successful_report_paths[@]}")
    echo "⏭️  Skipping overview synthesis: $reason" >&2
    return 1
  fi

  local overview_path=$(calculate_overview_path "$research_subdir")
  # Invoke overview synthesis agent...
  echo "$overview_path"
}
```

**Impact**: Reduce Phase 1 by ~40 lines, centralize overview logic

### 7. Performance Analysis

**Current Performance Metrics** (from command documentation):
- File creation rate: 100% (fail-fast enforcement)
- Context usage: <30% (target achieved via aggressive pruning)
- Wave-based time savings: 40-60% (for plans with parallel phases)
- Zero fallbacks: Single working path, fail-fast on errors

**Areas for Improvement**:

1. **Checkpoint Resume Speed**: Currently validates entire checkpoint structure on startup. Consider lazy loading for faster resume.

2. **Wave Calculation Caching**: Dependency analysis runs every time for Phase 3. Cache results to avoid recomputation on resume.

3. **Metadata Extraction Performance**: Uses multiple grep/sed passes per file. Consider single-pass parsing with awk.

### 8. Documentation and Maintainability

**Strengths**:
- Inline comments explain complex sections
- Clear section headers with line markers
- Usage examples for all 4 workflow types
- Architectural prohibitions explicitly documented

**Recommended Enhancements**:
1. Add function complexity metrics to library documentation
2. Create dependency graph visualization for library relationships
3. Document token budget allocation per phase (target vs actual)
4. Add troubleshooting section for common failure modes
