# This would be executed via Claude Code's /supervise command:
# /supervise "research authentication patterns"

# Expected behavior:
# 1. Workflow scope detected as: research-only
# 2. Phase 1: 4 research agents invoked in parallel
# 3. Phase 1: Research overview created
# 4. Phases 2-6: Skipped (not in scope)
# 5. Final output: Research reports only, no plan

# Verification points:
# [ ] Workflow scope: research-only
# [ ] 4 research reports created
# [ ] Research overview created
# [ ] No plan file created
# [ ] No implementation artifacts
# [ ] Progress markers: Phase 1 only
