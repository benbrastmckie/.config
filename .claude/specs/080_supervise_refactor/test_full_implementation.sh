# This would be executed via Claude Code's /supervise command:
# /supervise "implement oauth feature"

# Expected behavior:
# 1. Workflow scope detected as: research-plan-implement
# 2. Phase 1: 4 research agents invoked in parallel
# 3. Phase 1: Research overview created
# 4. Phase 2: Implementation plan created
# 5. Phase 3: Implementation agent executes plan
# 6. Phase 4: Testing agent validates implementation
# 7. Phase 5: Debug (conditional - only if tests fail)
# 8. Phase 6: Documentation summary created
# 9. Final output: Complete implementation with docs

# Verification points:
# [ ] Workflow scope: research-plan-implement
# [ ] 4 research reports created
# [ ] Research overview created
# [ ] Implementation plan created
# [ ] Implementation artifacts created
# [ ] Tests executed
# [ ] Summary documentation created
# [ ] Progress markers: Phases 1-4, 6 (5 conditional)
