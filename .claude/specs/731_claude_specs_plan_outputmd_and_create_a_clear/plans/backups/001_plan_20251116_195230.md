# Implementation Plan: Fix Plan Command Execution Failures

## Metadata
- **Date**: 2025-11-16
- **Feature**: Fix plan command errors from shell context isolation and missing Task invocations
- **Scope**: Refactor plan.md to combine library sourcing with execution and add explicit Task invocations
- **Estimated Phases**: 4
- **Estimated Hours**: 6-8 hours
- **Structure Level**: 0
- **Complexity Score**: 6.5/10
- **Standards File**: /home/benjamin/.config/CLAUDE.md
- **Research Reports**:
  - [Root Cause Analysis](../reports/001_topic1.md)
  - [Optimize-Claude Success Patterns](../reports/002_topic2.md)
  - [Standards Drift Analysis](../reports/003_topic3.md)

## Overview

The plan command fails due to bash shell context isolation where library functions sourced in one Bash tool invocation are not available in subsequent invocations. Additionally, the command uses imperative comments ("EXECUTE NOW: USE the Task tool") instead of actual Task invocations, resulting in agents never being invoked. This plan fixes both issues by:

1. Combining library sourcing with function execution in single bash blocks
2. Replacing imperative comments with explicit Task tool invocations (following optimize-claude pattern)
3. Removing placeholder fallbacks that mask agent failures
4. Adding fail-fast verification checkpoints

## Research Summary

### Root Cause Analysis (Report 001)
- **Primary Issue**: Each Bash tool call creates fresh shell - functions sourced in one call unavailable in next
- **Secondary Issue**: Array syntax `${!ARRAY[@]}` requires `set +H` to prevent history expansion errors
- **Evidence**: Lines 162-174 of plan_output.md show "command not found" errors for sourced functions
- **Solution Pattern**: Combine sourcing + execution in single bash block (successful at line 178)

### Optimize-Claude Success Patterns (Report 002)
- **Key Difference**: optimize-claude has explicit Task blocks embedded in markdown, not just comments
- **Verification**: Mandatory checkpoints after each agent wave with fail-fast behavior
- **No Placeholders**: Never creates fallback files - failures terminate with clear errors
- **Simple Dependencies**: Only 1 library (unified-location-detection.sh) vs 7 in plan command
- **Path Pre-Calculation**: All paths calculated before agent invocation using simple bash string concatenation

### Standards Compliance Analysis (Report 003)
- **No Drift Found**: Plan command correctly implements Standard 11 (imperative invocation) and Standard 15 (library sourcing order)
- **Timeline**: Plan command created Oct-Nov 2024 DURING standards formalization period
- **Compliance**: Standards were incorporated from inception, not retrofitted
- **Conclusion**: Standards are not the problem - execution model mismatch is the issue

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Plan command executes without "command not found" errors
- [ ] Plan command executes without "bad substitution" errors
- [ ] Research agents are actually invoked (not just commented about)
- [ ] Plan-architect agent is actually invoked (not just commented about)
- [ ] Agent failures result in clear error messages (no placeholder files created)
- [ ] All verification checkpoints execute and fail-fast on errors
- [ ] Test execution completes successfully with existing test cases
- [ ] Command maintains Standard 11 and Standard 15 compliance

## Technical Design

### Architecture Changes

**Current Architecture (Broken)**:
```
Phase 0 bash block: Source libraries
Phase 1 bash block: Use functions → ERROR: functions not found
Phase 1.5 bash comment: "EXECUTE NOW: USE Task tool" → No actual invocation
Phase 3 bash comment: "EXECUTE NOW: USE Task tool" → No actual invocation
```

**New Architecture (Fixed)**:
```
Phase 0 bash block: Source libraries + execute path calculation + execute complexity analysis
Phase 1.5: Explicit Task invocations for research agents (parallel)
  → VERIFICATION CHECKPOINT (mandatory)
Phase 3: Explicit Task invocation for plan-architect agent
  → VERIFICATION CHECKPOINT (mandatory)
```

### Key Design Decisions

1. **Consolidate Phase 0 and Phase 1**: Merge library sourcing with complexity analysis into single bash block to prevent context loss

2. **Replace Comments with Task Blocks**: Convert imperative comments to actual Task invocations following optimize-claude pattern:
   ```markdown
   Task {
     subagent_type: "general-purpose"
     description: "Research [topic]"
     prompt: "
       Read and follow ALL behavioral guidelines from:
       ${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}/.claude/agents/research-specialist.md

       **CRITICAL**: Create report file at EXACT path provided above.
     "
   }
   ```

3. **Remove Placeholder Fallbacks**: Delete placeholder creation blocks (lines 411-449, 619-696) that mask agent failures

4. **Add Verification Checkpoints**: After each agent wave, verify files exist and fail-fast with diagnostic messages

5. **Simplify Dependencies**: Keep all 7 libraries for now (Standard 15 compliant) but ensure they're used in single context

## Implementation Phases

## Dependencies

### Internal Dependencies
- /.claude/lib/detect-project-dir.sh
- /.claude/lib/workflow-state-machine.sh
- /.claude/lib/state-persistence.sh
- /.claude/lib/error-handling.sh
- /.claude/lib/verification-helpers.sh
- /.claude/lib/unified-location-detection.sh
- /.claude/lib/complexity-utils.sh
- /.claude/lib/metadata-extraction.sh
- /.claude/agents/research-specialist.md
- /.claude/agents/plan-architect.md
- /.claude/commands/optimize-claude.md (reference pattern)

### External Dependencies
- bash (with `set +H` support)
- jq (JSON processing)
- Standard Unix utilities (grep, sed, tr, wc, etc.)

## Rollback Strategy

If issues occur during implementation:
1. Git revert to last known good state
2. Document specific failure mode in issue tracker
3. Re-evaluate architectural approach if fundamental issue discovered
4. Consider phased rollout (Phase 1 → test → Phase 2 → test → etc.)

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|--------|------------|
| Breaking existing /plan users | Low | High | Maintain backward compatibility; test extensively |
| Task invocations fail in some contexts | Medium | High | Add fallback with clear error messages |
| Library sourcing still fails in consolidated block | Low | Critical | Add diagnostic output; test thoroughly |
| Verification checkpoints too strict | Low | Medium | Make verification messages clear; allow override flag if needed |
| Standards drift during refactor | Low | Medium | Verify Standard 11 and 15 compliance after each phase |

## Notes

### Implementation Approach
- This is a critical fix, not a feature enhancement
- Preserve all existing functionality during refactor
- Focus on execution model, not standards (standards are correct)
- Follow optimize-claude pattern as proven working reference
- Maintain Standard 11 and Standard 15 compliance throughout

### Key Insights from Research
1. Shell context isolation is THE root cause (Report 001)
2. Optimize-claude works because it uses explicit Task invocations (Report 002)
3. Standards are NOT the problem - they're correctly implemented (Report 003)
4. Solution: Combine bash blocks + add Task invocations + remove placeholders

### Success Metrics
- Zero "command not found" errors
- Zero "bad substitution" errors
- 100% agent invocation rate (research + planning)
- Clear failure messages (no silent placeholder fallbacks)
- Maintained Standard 11 and 15 compliance
