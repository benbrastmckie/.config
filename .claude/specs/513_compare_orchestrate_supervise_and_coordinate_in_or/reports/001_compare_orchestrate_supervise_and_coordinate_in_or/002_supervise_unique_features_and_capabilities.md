**[← Return to Overview](./OVERVIEW.md)**

## Metadata
- **Date**: 2025-10-28
- **Agent**: research-specialist
- **Topic**: Supervise unique features and capabilities compared to /orchestrate and /coordinate
- **Report Type**: Command feature analysis and comparison

## Executive Summary

The `/supervise` command distinguishes itself from `/orchestrate` and `/coordinate` through three primary unique features: (1) proven fail-fast error handling with structured 5-section diagnostics achieving 100% file creation reliability with zero retry overhead, (2) comprehensive external documentation ecosystem including dedicated usage guide and phase reference that reduce command file size by 14% while improving maintainability, and (3) sequential execution pattern validated through extensive refactoring (Spec 507) demonstrating 40-60% faster implementation than estimated through library consolidation and explicit context pruning integration.

## Findings

### 1. Fail-Fast Error Handling with Structured Diagnostics

**Unique Implementation** (lines 147-176 in supervise.md):

`/supervise` is the **only orchestration command** with fully implemented fail-fast error handling using structured 5-section diagnostic templates at all 7 verification checkpoints.

**Diagnostic Format** (supervise.md:469-509):
1. **ERROR**: Clear description of what failed
2. **Expected/Found**: What was supposed to happen vs what actually happened
3. **DIAGNOSTIC INFORMATION**: Paths, directory status, agent details
4. **Diagnostic Commands**: Example commands to debug the issue
5. **Most Likely Causes**: Common reasons for this failure

**Example Implementation** (Phase 1 verification, lines 650-734):
```bash
if [ -f "$REPORT_PATH" ] && [ -s "$REPORT_PATH" ]; then
  # Success path - concise output with file size
  FILE_SIZE_KB=$(awk "BEGIN {printf \"%.1f\", $FILE_SIZE/1024}")
  echo "  ✅ VERIFIED: Report $i created (${FILE_SIZE_KB} KB, ${LINE_COUNT} lines)"
else
  # Failure path - structured 5-section diagnostic
  echo "  ❌ ERROR [Phase 1, Research]: Report file verification failed"
  echo "     Expected: File exists and has content"
  # ... [Complete 5-section diagnostic follows]
  exit 1
fi
```

**Performance Characteristics**:
- **Error feedback**: Immediate (<1s) vs 3-5s retry delay in older patterns
- **File creation rate**: 100% (verified via test suite, Spec 507 implementation summary:106)
- **Bootstrap reliability**: 100% (fail-fast exposes configuration errors immediately)
- **Overhead**: Zero retry infrastructure, simpler code (+182/-120 lines for diagnostics, net +62)

**Comparison with Other Commands**:
- `/coordinate`: Has fail-fast pattern but less comprehensive diagnostics (18 instances of "fail-fast" vs 19 in supervise)
- `/orchestrate`: No structured fail-fast implementation (2 instances of "diagnostic" vs 15 in supervise)

### 2. Comprehensive External Documentation Ecosystem

**Unique Documentation Structure**:

`/supervise` is the **only orchestration command** with dedicated external documentation files that separate usage patterns from technical reference.

**Documentation Files Created** (Spec 507, Phase 3):

1. **Usage Guide** (`.claude/docs/guides/supervise-guide.md` - 7.2 KB):
   - 4 workflow scope types with examples
   - Common usage patterns (exploratory research, research-driven planning, end-to-end development, bug investigation)
   - Best practices (specific descriptions, appropriate keywords, automatic scope detection)
   - Troubleshooting section (agent failures, incorrect scope, test failures)
   - Performance targets (context usage <25%, file creation 100%, error feedback <1s)

2. **Phase Reference** (`.claude/docs/reference/supervise-phases.md` - 14.3 KB):
   - Detailed phase-by-phase technical documentation
   - Agent invocation patterns for all 7 phases
   - Verification checkpoint patterns with fail-fast examples
   - Success criteria for each phase
   - Partial failure handling logic (Phase 1 research only)
   - Checkpoint recovery implementation details

**Documentation Integration** (supervise.md:113-117, 395-397):
```markdown
**DOCUMENTATION**: For complete usage guide, see [/supervise Usage Guide](../docs/guides/supervise-guide.md)

**PHASE REFERENCE**: For detailed phase documentation, see [/supervise Phase Reference](../docs/reference/supervise-phases.md)
```

**Impact on Command File**:
- Reduced inline documentation: 2,274 → 1,941 lines (-333 lines, -14%)
- Limited reduction because most content is execution-critical per Command Architecture Standards
- Improved maintainability: Documentation separate from execution logic

**Comparison with Other Commands**:
- `/coordinate`: No external documentation files (3,000 lines inline)
- `/orchestrate`: References `.claude/docs/reference/orchestration-patterns.md` but no dedicated usage guide (5,438 lines)

### 3. Sequential Execution Pattern with Library Consolidation

**Unique Architectural Approach**:

`/supervise` uses **sequential phase execution** (no wave-based parallelization) which enabled aggressive library consolidation and validation through extensive refactoring.

**Library Sourcing Consolidation** (Spec 507, Phase 2/5, supervise.md:206-236):

Before (126 lines of individual library sourcing):
```bash
# Source library 1
if [ -f "$SCRIPT_DIR/../lib/library1.sh" ]; then
  source "$SCRIPT_DIR/../lib/library1.sh"
else
  echo "ERROR: library1.sh not found"
  exit 1
fi
# ... [Repeat for 7 libraries]
```

After (25 lines using consolidated pattern):
```bash
# Source library-sourcing utilities first
source "$SCRIPT_DIR/../lib/library-sourcing.sh"

# Source all required libraries using consolidated function
if ! source_required_libraries; then
  exit 1
fi
```

**Reduction**: 90% code reduction (126 → 25 lines)

**Context Pruning Integration** (Spec 507, Phase 4, supervise.md:877-881, 1128-1136, 1274-1282):

Explicit pruning calls added after each phase:
- Phase 1: `store_phase_metadata()` for research metadata
- Phase 2: `apply_pruning_policy("planning")` with reduction reporting
- Phase 3: `apply_pruning_policy("implementation")` with reduction reporting
- Phase 4: `store_phase_metadata()` for test results
- Phase 5: `apply_pruning_policy("debug")` with reduction reporting
- Phase 6: `apply_pruning_policy("final")` with reduction reporting

**Performance**:
- Context usage target: <30% (achievable through explicit pruning)
- Context reduction reporting: Integrated percentage tracking
- Overhead: +58 lines (+3%) for pruning infrastructure

**Validation Through Refactoring** (Spec 507):
- **Estimated time**: 21-30 hours
- **Actual time**: ~12 hours (40-60% faster)
- **Test results**: 11/12 passing (baseline maintained)
- **Delegation rate**: >90% (verified)

**Comparison with Other Commands**:
- `/coordinate`: Wave-based execution (40-60% time savings), library consolidation not documented
- `/orchestrate`: Most complex (5,438 lines), no documented library consolidation

### 4. Partial Failure Handling in Research Phase

**Unique Feature**:

`/supervise` is the **only orchestration command** that explicitly supports partial failure handling during parallel research (Phase 1).

**Implementation** (supervise.md:746-757):
```bash
# Partial failure handling - allow continuation if ≥50% success
if [ $VERIFICATION_FAILURES -gt 0 ]; then
  DECISION=$(handle_partial_research_failure $RESEARCH_COMPLEXITY $SUCCESSFUL_REPORT_COUNT "${FAILED_AGENTS[*]}")

  if [ "$DECISION" == "terminate" ]; then
    echo "Workflow TERMINATED. Fix research issues and retry."
    exit 1
  fi

  # Continue with partial results
  echo "⚠️  Continuing workflow with partial research results"
fi
```

**Logic** (supervise-phases.md:513-531):
- **Termination condition**: Less than 50% of research agents succeeded
- **Continuation condition**: At least 50% of research agents succeeded
- **Applies to**: Phase 1 (Research) only
- **All other phases**: Require 100% success (fail-fast on any error)

**Rationale**:
Research phase uses 2-4 parallel agents for different subtopics. Partial results (e.g., 2 out of 3 agents succeed) can still provide sufficient information for planning, whereas implementation/testing require complete success.

**Comparison with Other Commands**:
- `/coordinate`: No documented partial failure handling
- `/orchestrate`: No documented partial failure handling

### 5. Checkpoint Recovery Infrastructure

**Implementation Status**:

Checkpoints are **saved but automatic resume not yet implemented** (supervise-phases.md:533-560).

**Checkpoint Save Points** (supervise.md:862-869, 1073-1080, 1256-1265, 1376-1386):
- After Phase 1: Research complete
- After Phase 2: Planning complete
- After Phase 3: Implementation complete
- After Phase 4: Testing complete

**Checkpoint Schema** (supervise-phases.md:547-556):
```json
{
  "workflow_scope": "full-implementation",
  "current_phase": "3",
  "research_reports": ["path1", "path2"],
  "plan_path": "path/to/plan.md",
  "impl_artifacts": "path/to/artifacts/",
  "test_status": "passing"
}
```

**Cleanup** (supervise.md:1924-1929):
```bash
# Clean up checkpoint on successful completion
CHECKPOINT_FILE=".claude/data/checkpoints/supervise_latest.json"
if [ -f "$CHECKPOINT_FILE" ]; then
  rm -f "$CHECKPOINT_FILE"
fi
```

**Comparison with Other Commands**:
- `/coordinate`: Uses checkpoint API but implementation details not documented
- `/orchestrate`: Has checkpoint infrastructure (workflow_state structure)

### 6. Dual-Mode Progress Reporting

**Unique Implementation**:

`/supervise` uses **dual-mode progress reporting** combining silent automation markers with user-visible status messages.

**Pattern** (Spec 507 implementation summary:27):
- **Silent markers**: `PROGRESS: [Phase N] - [action]` for monitoring/automation
- **User-visible status**: Concise single-line updates for terminal display

**Example** (supervise.md:559, 871-873):
```bash
# Emit dual-mode progress reporting after Phase 0
emit_progress "0" "Phase 0 complete - paths calculated"
echo "✓ Phase 0 complete: Paths calculated, directory structure ready"
```

**Benefits**:
- Automation capabilities (parseable PROGRESS: markers)
- Clean UX (minimal well-formatted terminal output)
- No truncation issues (concise messages)

**Comparison with Other Commands**:
- `/coordinate`: Uses PROGRESS markers but dual-mode pattern not documented
- `/orchestrate`: TodoWrite integration for progress tracking (different approach)

### 7. Research Complexity-Based Agent Scaling

**Unique Implementation**:

`/supervise` dynamically determines research complexity (1-4 topics) based on workflow description keywords.

**Complexity Scoring** (supervise.md:590-608):
```bash
RESEARCH_COMPLEXITY=2  # Default: 2 research topics

# Increase complexity for these keywords
if echo "$WORKFLOW_DESCRIPTION" | grep -Eiq "integrate|migration|refactor|architecture"; then
  RESEARCH_COMPLEXITY=3
fi

# Increase further for very complex workflows
if echo "$WORKFLOW_DESCRIPTION" | grep -Eiq "multi-.*system|cross-.*platform|distributed|microservices"; then
  RESEARCH_COMPLEXITY=4
fi

# Reduce for simple workflows
if echo "$WORKFLOW_DESCRIPTION" | grep -Eiq "^(fix|update|modify).*(one|single|small)"; then
  RESEARCH_COMPLEXITY=1
fi
```

**Agent Scaling**:
- Simple workflow: 1 research agent
- Default workflow: 2 research agents
- Complex workflow: 3 research agents
- Very complex workflow: 4 research agents

**Comparison with Other Commands**:
- `/coordinate`: Uses 2-4 agents but complexity calculation not documented
- `/orchestrate`: Research topic identification but complexity scoring not documented

## Recommendations

### 1. Leverage Fail-Fast Pattern for Other Commands

The fail-fast error handling with structured 5-section diagnostics from `/supervise` should be adopted by `/coordinate` and `/orchestrate` for consistency and improved debugging experience.

**Action**: Extract diagnostic template to shared library (`.claude/lib/diagnostic-templates.sh`)

### 2. Standardize External Documentation Pattern

The external documentation approach (usage guide + phase reference) improves maintainability and should be extended to `/coordinate` and `/orchestrate`.

**Action**: Create `.claude/docs/guides/coordinate-guide.md` and `.claude/docs/guides/orchestrate-guide.md`

### 3. Complete Checkpoint Recovery Implementation

Checkpoint save infrastructure exists but automatic resume is not yet implemented. Completing this feature would enable resumable workflows.

**Action**: Implement checkpoint restore logic at workflow start (similar to `/implement` command)

### 4. Document Partial Failure Handling

The partial failure handling pattern (≥50% research success) is unique and valuable. This logic should be extracted to a shared library function.

**Action**: Create `handle_partial_failure()` in `.claude/lib/failure-handling.sh` with configurable thresholds

### 5. Validate Context Pruning Effectiveness

Explicit context pruning calls are integrated but actual context usage metrics should be tracked during workflows to validate <30% target achievement.

**Action**: Implement context usage tracking in `unified-logger.sh` with reporting at workflow completion
