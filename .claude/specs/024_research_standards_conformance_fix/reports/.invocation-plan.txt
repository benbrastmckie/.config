Topics:
[0] Error Analysis in Research Output: Analyze the /home/benjamin/.config/.claude/output/research-output.md file to identify and understand errors that occurred during /research command execution, including error messages, failure patterns, and root causes -> /home/benjamin/.config/.claude/specs/024_research_standards_conformance_fix/reports/001-error-analysis-research-output.md
[1] Standards Conformance Assessment: Research the .claude/docs/ standards documentation to understand which standards are being violated, what conformance requirements apply to the research workflow, and identify gaps between current implementation and requirements -> /home/benjamin/.config/.claude/specs/024_research_standards_conformance_fix/reports/002-standards-conformance-assessment.md
[2] Standards Revision Strategy: Evaluate whether errors indicate code issues that need fixing or indicate problematic standards that should be revised, establish criteria for when to modify standards vs. fix code, and plan revision approach if needed -> /home/benjamin/.config/.claude/specs/024_research_standards_conformance_fix/reports/003-standards-revision-strategy.md
