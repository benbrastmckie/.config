# /coordinate Command Structure Analysis

## Metadata
- **Date**: 2025-10-27
- **Agent**: research-specialist
- **Topic**: Analyze the /coordinate command structure and architecture
- **Report Type**: codebase analysis

## Executive Summary

The /coordinate command is a well-structured orchestration command at 2,148 lines, implementing wave-based parallel execution with fail-fast error handling. Analysis reveals excellent architectural compliance with Command Architecture Standards (Standard 11), with 37 imperative enforcement patterns and comprehensive verification checkpoints. The command exhibits moderate structural bloat in utility documentation (120 lines of reference tables marked [REFERENCE-OK]) and repetitive verification patterns across 6 phases. Streamlining opportunities exist through: (1) consolidating verification logic into reusable patterns, (2) extracting utility function documentation to library reference files, (3) reducing redundancy in error diagnostic templates, and (4) simplifying phase completion checkpoint blocks. Estimated reduction: 200-300 lines (9-14%) without compromising execution-critical content, resulting in target size of 1,850-1,950 lines.

### 2. Sections Suitable for Consolidation or Simplification

**Section A: Available Utility Functions (Lines 471-517)**
- **Current**: 47 lines of function reference tables
- **Annotation**: [REFERENCE-OK: Can be supplemented with external library documentation]
- **Content**: 4 tables documenting 12 utility functions from sourced libraries
- **Analysis**: This is pure reference material that duplicates library API documentation
- **Consolidation Opportunity**: Replace with 10-line summary + reference to library documentation
- **Reduction Potential**: 37 lines (80% reduction)

**Section B: Retained Usage Examples (Lines 518-590)**
- **Current**: 73 lines of usage examples
- **Annotation**: [REFERENCE-OK: Examples can be moved to library documentation if needed]
- **Content**: 4 examples showing library function usage patterns
- **Analysis**: Examples are helpful but marked as extractable per standards
- **Consolidation Opportunity**: Keep 1 core example inline, reference library docs for others
- **Reduction Potential**: 50 lines (68% reduction)

**Section C: Optimization Note (Lines 592-620)**
- **Current**: 29 lines of refactoring history and lessons learned
- **Content**: Historical context about integration approach vs building from scratch
- **Analysis**: Valuable for maintainers but not execution-critical
- **Consolidation Opportunity**: Reduce to 5-line summary with reference to full analysis report
- **Reduction Potential**: 24 lines (83% reduction)

**Section D: Repeated Verification Patterns**
The command contains 6 nearly identical verification checkpoint blocks:
- Phase 1 Research: Lines 867-985 (119 lines)
- Phase 2 Planning: Lines 1144-1224 (81 lines)
- Phase 3 Implementation: Lines 1401-1516 (116 lines)
- Phase 4 Testing: Lines 1564-1631 (68 lines)
- Phase 5 Debug: Lines 1657-1848 (192 lines - includes iteration loop)
- Phase 6 Documentation: Lines 1902-1981 (80 lines)

**Common Pattern in Each Verification Block**:
```bash
echo "════════════════════════════════════════════════════════"
echo "  MANDATORY VERIFICATION - [Artifact Type]"
echo "════════════════════════════════════════════════════════"
echo ""

# Check if file exists and has content
if [ -f "$EXPECTED_PATH" ] && [ -s "$EXPECTED_PATH" ]; then
  # Success path - quality checks
  # ... artifact-specific validation ...
  echo "✅ VERIFIED: [Success message]"
else
  # Failure path - comprehensive diagnostics
  echo "❌ ERROR: [Failure description]"
  echo "   Expected: [What was expected]"
  echo "   Found: [What was found]"
  echo ""
  echo "DIAGNOSTIC INFORMATION:"
  echo "  - [Context details]"
  echo ""
  echo "Directory Status:"
  # ... directory listing ...
  echo ""
  echo "Possible Causes:"
  # ... 4-5 bullet points ...
  echo ""
  echo "What to check next:"
  # ... 4 numbered steps ...
  echo ""
  exit 1
fi
```

**Consolidation Opportunity**:
- Create verification function template that takes parameters (artifact_type, path, quality_checks)
- Reduce repetitive diagnostic blocks by 40-50%
- **Reduction Potential**: 100-120 lines across all phases

### 3. Redundant Content or Duplicated Patterns

**Redundancy Category 1: Error Diagnostic Templates**

All 6 verification blocks contain identical diagnostic structure:
- "DIAGNOSTIC INFORMATION:" header (6 occurrences)
- "Directory Status:" section with ls -la commands (6 occurrences)
- "Possible Causes:" list with 4-5 standard items (6 occurrences)
- "What to check next:" numbered checklist (6 occurrences)

**Analysis**: While fail-fast error handling requires comprehensive diagnostics, the template structure is 90% identical across phases. Only agent names and artifact types differ.

**Redundancy Category 2: Checkpoint Save/Restore Patterns**

Each phase ends with nearly identical checkpoint saving:
```bash
# Save checkpoint after Phase N
ARTIFACT_PATHS_JSON=$(cat <<EOF
{
  "research_reports": [...],
  "plan_path": "...",
  # ... phase-specific paths ...
}
EOF
)
save_checkpoint "coordinate" "phase_N" "$ARTIFACT_PATHS_JSON"

# Context pruning after Phase N
store_phase_metadata "phase_N" "complete" "$METADATA"
apply_pruning_policy "..." "$WORKFLOW_SCOPE"
echo "Phase N metadata stored (context reduction: 80-90%)"
```

This pattern appears 6 times (once per phase) with minimal variation.

**Redundancy Category 3: Phase Execution Checks**

Each phase starts with identical execution check:
```bash
should_run_phase N || {
  echo "⏭️  Skipping Phase N ([Phase Name])"
  echo "  Reason: Workflow type is $WORKFLOW_SCOPE"
  echo ""
  [exit or continue]
}
```

**Analysis**: This is necessary for conditional phase execution but could be streamlined.

### 4. Comparison with Command Architecture Standards

**Compliance Assessment**:

✅ **Standard 0 (Execution Enforcement)**: Excellent compliance
- 37 imperative markers (EXECUTE NOW, MANDATORY, CRITICAL, VERIFICATION REQUIRED)
- All critical operations have explicit verification checkpoints
- No assumptions without verification (e.g., lines 891-948 Research verification)

✅ **Standard 1 (Executable Instructions Must Be Inline)**: Full compliance
- All execution steps are inline and numbered
- Complete Task invocation examples (lines 87-103, 841-860, 1124-1143)
- No truncated templates or "See external file" anti-patterns

✅ **Standard 2 (Reference Pattern)**: Proper usage
- Lines 473, 520: Correctly marked [REFERENCE-OK]
- References appear AFTER inline instructions, not as replacements

✅ **Standard 3 (Critical Information Density)**: Exceeds requirements
- Comprehensive execution steps for all 7 phases
- Multiple complete tool invocation examples
- Detailed error handling for all failure modes
- 4 complete end-to-end workflow examples (lines 2047-2094)

✅ **Standard 4 (Template Completeness)**: Full compliance
- Task invocation templates are complete and copy-paste ready
- No "[See...]" references in critical sections
- Agent prompts include all required parameters

✅ **Standard 5 (Structural Annotations)**: Partial compliance
- Lines 352, 473, 520: [EXECUTION-CRITICAL], [REFERENCE-OK] annotations present
- Missing annotations on some sections that could be extracted

✅ **Standard 11 (Imperative Agent Invocation)**: Excellent compliance
- Line 841: "**EXECUTE NOW**: USE the Task tool for each topic..."
- Line 1124: "**EXECUTE NOW**: USE the Task tool with these parameters:"
- All agent invocations reference `.claude/agents/*.md` behavioral files
- No documentation-only YAML blocks
- Completion signals required in all agent prompts

✅ **Standard 12 (Structural vs Behavioral Separation)**: Good compliance
- Structural templates (Task invocations, bash blocks) are inline
- Behavioral content references agent files (.claude/agents/*.md)
- No STEP sequence duplication from agent files

**Standards Deviation**: None detected. The command fully complies with all applicable standards.

### 5. Inline vs External Reference Opportunities

**Currently Marked for Extraction** ([REFERENCE-OK] annotations):

1. **Lines 473-517**: Available Utility Functions
   - Annotation: [REFERENCE-OK: Can be supplemented with external library documentation]
   - Extraction Target: `.claude/docs/reference/library-api.md`
   - Retention Requirement: Keep 5-10 line summary inline

2. **Lines 520-590**: Retained Usage Examples
   - Annotation: [REFERENCE-OK: Examples can be moved to library documentation if needed]
   - Extraction Target: Library-specific documentation
   - Retention Requirement: Keep 1 example inline (workflow scope detection)

3. **Lines 592-620**: Optimization Note (Historical Context)
   - No annotation but clearly historical/reference material
   - Extraction Target: `.claude/specs/438_*/reports/OVERVIEW.md` (already exists)
   - Retention Requirement: 2-3 line summary with link

**Additional Extraction Opportunities**:

4. **Lines 2043-2094**: Usage Examples (52 lines)
   - Content: 4 complete workflow examples
   - Extraction Target: `.claude/docs/guides/coordinate-usage-guide.md`
   - Retention Requirement: Keep 1 example inline (research-and-plan, most common)

5. **Lines 2096-2148**: Performance Metrics and Success Criteria (53 lines)
   - Content: Performance targets, success criteria checklists
   - Extraction Target: `.claude/docs/reference/orchestration-metrics.md`
   - Retention Requirement: Keep 3-line performance target summary inline

**Total Extraction Potential**:
- Lines from sections: 47 + 73 + 29 + 52 + 53 = 254 lines
- After retention requirements: ~200 lines net reduction
- Percentage reduction: 9.3% (200/2,148)

**Caution on Verification Block Consolidation**:
While verification blocks show repetitive patterns, they contain phase-specific error diagnostics that are execution-critical per Standard 1. Consolidation must preserve fail-fast error reporting quality. Recommended approach: Create verification function template but keep diagnostic details inline with parameters.

## Recommendations

### Recommendation 1: Extract Utility Function Documentation (HIGH PRIORITY)

**Action**: Move lines 471-517 (Available Utility Functions) to external library reference documentation.

**Rationale**:
- Section is explicitly marked [REFERENCE-OK] per Standard 5
- Content duplicates library API documentation
- 80% reduction opportunity (47 lines → 10 lines)

**Implementation**:
1. Create `.claude/docs/reference/library-api.md` with complete function reference tables
2. Replace lines 471-517 with:
```markdown
## Utility Functions Reference

All utility functions sourced from `.claude/lib/` libraries:
- **Workflow Detection**: `detect_workflow_scope()`, `should_run_phase()` (workflow-detection.sh)
- **Error Handling**: `classify_error()`, `suggest_recovery()` (error-handling.sh)
- **Checkpoint Management**: `save_checkpoint()`, `restore_checkpoint()` (checkpoint-utils.sh)
- **Progress Logging**: `emit_progress()` (unified-logger.sh)

**Complete API Reference**: See [Library API Documentation](../docs/reference/library-api.md)
```

**Impact**: -37 lines, improves maintainability (single source of truth for library APIs)

### Recommendation 2: Consolidate Usage Examples (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

**Action**: Reduce lines 518-590 (Retained Usage Examples) to single inline example with references.

**Rationale**:
- Section marked [REFERENCE-OK] per Standard 5
- 4 examples demonstrate library usage patterns (can be in library docs)
- Keep 1 execution-critical example inline per Standard 3

**Implementation**:
1. Move Examples 2-4 to library-specific documentation
2. Retain Example 1 (Workflow Scope Detection) as it's most execution-critical
3. Replace lines 550-590 with reference:
```markdown
**For Additional Library Usage Examples**: See [Library API Documentation](../docs/reference/library-api.md#usage-patterns)
```

**Impact**: -50 lines, retains execution-critical example

### Recommendation 3: Reduce Historical Context Section (LOW PRIORITY)

**Action**: Compress lines 592-620 (Optimization Note) to brief summary with reference.

**Rationale**:
- Historical context valuable for maintainers but not execution-critical
- Full analysis already exists in linked research report
- 83% reduction opportunity (29 lines → 5 lines)

**Implementation**:
Replace lines 592-620 with:
```markdown
## Optimization Note: Integration Approach

This command was built using an "integrate, not build" approach, leveraging existing libraries for location detection, metadata extraction, and context pruning instead of rebuilding infrastructure. This approach saved 4-5 days development time and ensured 100% consistency with existing patterns.

**Complete Analysis**: [Research Report Overview](../specs/438_analysis_of_supervise_command_refactor_plan_for_re/reports/001_analysis_of_supervise_command_refactor_plan_for_re_research/OVERVIEW.md)
```

**Impact**: -24 lines

### Recommendation 4: Consolidate Verification Logic Patterns (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

**Action**: Create reusable verification pattern to reduce repetitive diagnostic blocks across 6 phases.

**Rationale**:
- Verification blocks share 90% identical structure (lines 867-985, 1144-1224, 1401-1516, 1564-1631, 1902-1981)
- Consolidation can reduce 100-120 lines while preserving fail-fast diagnostics
- Maintains Standard 1 compliance (execution-critical content stays inline)

**Implementation**:
1. Create inline verification pattern template (keep in command file per Standard 1):
```bash
# Reusable verification pattern (defined once, used 6 times)
verify_artifact_created() {
  local artifact_type="$1"
  local expected_path="$2"
  local agent_name="$3"
  local quality_check_cmd="$4"  # Optional

  echo "════════════════════════════════════════════════════════"
  echo "  MANDATORY VERIFICATION - $artifact_type"
  echo "════════════════════════════════════════════════════════"
  echo ""

  if [ -f "$expected_path" ] && [ -s "$expected_path" ]; then
    # Success path
    if [ -n "$quality_check_cmd" ]; then
      eval "$quality_check_cmd"  # Phase-specific validation
    fi
    echo "✅ VERIFIED: $artifact_type created at $expected_path"
  else
    # Failure path - comprehensive diagnostics
    echo "❌ ERROR: $artifact_type verification failed"
    echo "   Expected: File exists at $expected_path"
    [ ! -f "$expected_path" ] && echo "   Found: File does not exist"
    [ ! -s "$expected_path" ] && echo "   Found: File exists but is empty"
    echo ""
    echo "DIAGNOSTIC INFORMATION:"
    echo "  - Agent: $agent_name"
    echo "  - Expected path: $expected_path"
    echo "  - Directory: $(dirname "$expected_path")"
    # [Standard diagnostic template continues...]
    exit 1
  fi
}
```

2. Replace each verification block with function call:
```bash
# Phase 1 Research (replaces lines 867-985)
verify_artifact_created "Research Report" "$REPORT_PATH" "research-specialist" \
  "FILE_SIZE=\$(wc -c < \"$REPORT_PATH\"); [ \$FILE_SIZE -lt 200 ] && echo 'WARNING: Small file'"

# Phase 2 Planning (replaces lines 1144-1224)
verify_artifact_created "Implementation Plan" "$PLAN_PATH" "plan-architect" \
  "PHASE_COUNT=\$(grep -c '^### Phase' \"$PLAN_PATH\"); [ \$PHASE_COUNT -lt 3 ] && echo 'WARNING: Few phases'"
```

**Impact**: -100 to -120 lines across all phases, improves consistency

**Caution**: Must preserve phase-specific quality checks and error diagnostics per Standard 1. Function approach keeps verification logic inline while reducing duplication.

### Recommendation 5: Streamline Workflow Example Section (LOW PRIORITY)

**Action**: Extract 3 of 4 usage examples (lines 2047-2094) to usage guide, retain most common example inline.

**Rationale**:
- 4 workflow examples provided, but only "research-and-plan" is marked as MOST COMMON (line 2059)
- Other examples (research-only, full-implementation, debug-only) can be in external usage guide
- Reduces 40 lines while retaining critical reference

**Implementation**:
1. Create `.claude/docs/guides/coordinate-usage-guide.md` with all 4 examples
2. Replace lines 2047-2094 with:
```markdown
## Usage Example: Research-and-Plan Workflow (MOST COMMON)

```bash
/coordinate "research the authentication module to create a refactor plan"

# Expected behavior:
# - Scope detected: research-and-plan
# - Phases executed: 0, 1, 2
# - Artifacts: 4 research reports + 1 implementation plan
# - No implementation, no summary (per standards)
# - Plan ready for execution
```

**For Additional Workflow Examples**: See [/coordinate Usage Guide](../docs/guides/coordinate-usage-guide.md)
```

**Impact**: -40 lines

### Recommendation 6: Extract Performance Metrics to Reference Documentation (LOW PRIORITY)

**Action**: Move Success Criteria checklists (lines 2106-2148) to orchestration metrics reference.

**Rationale**:
- Success criteria are validation checklists, not execution instructions
- Can be referenced during testing/review phases
- Maintains 3-line performance target summary inline per Standard 3

**Implementation**:
1. Create `.claude/docs/reference/orchestration-metrics.md` with complete success criteria
2. Replace lines 2106-2148 with:
```markdown
## Performance Targets

- **File Creation Rate**: 100% (fail-fast verification)
- **Context Usage**: <25% cumulative across phases
- **Wave-Based Time Savings**: 40-60% for parallel-capable plans

**Complete Success Criteria and Metrics**: See [Orchestration Metrics Reference](../docs/reference/orchestration-metrics.md)
```

**Impact**: -40 lines

### Summary of Recommendations

| Recommendation | Priority | Lines Saved | Complexity | Standards Risk |
|----------------|----------|-------------|------------|----------------|
| 1. Extract Utility Function Docs | HIGH | 37 | Low | None (marked REFERENCE-OK) |
| 2. Consolidate Usage Examples | MEDIUM | 50 | Low | None (marked REFERENCE-OK) |
| 3. Reduce Historical Context | LOW | 24 | Low | None (supplemental only) |
| 4. Consolidate Verification Logic | MEDIUM | 100-120 | Medium | Low (keep inline per Standard 1) |
| 5. Streamline Workflow Examples | LOW | 40 | Low | None (keep 1 example) |
| 6. Extract Performance Metrics | LOW | 40 | Low | None (reference material) |
| **TOTALS** | - | **291-311** | - | **Minimal** |

**Projected File Size After Streamlining**: 1,837-1,857 lines (13.5-14.5% reduction)

**Risk Assessment**: All recommendations preserve execution-critical content per Standard 1. Verification consolidation (Rec 4) requires careful implementation to maintain fail-fast diagnostics but offers highest impact.
