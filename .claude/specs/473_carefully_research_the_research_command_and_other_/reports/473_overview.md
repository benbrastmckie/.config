# /research Command Improvements - Research Overview

## Executive Summary

The `/research` command is a well-architected 566-line hierarchical multi-agent orchestrator demonstrating 95/100 compliance with command architecture standards. The system achieves 92-97% context reduction through metadata extraction and 40-60% time savings via parallel agent coordination. However, analysis reveals significant optimization opportunities: 40% prompt bloat through inline agent invocation templates, redundant verification checkpoints consuming 120 lines, and underutilized performance patterns (Forward Message, Context Pruning). Quick wins could reduce command size by 226 lines (40%) and context usage by 8,000 tokens (23%) while maintaining architectural integrity. The infrastructure includes 69 library files with one 85KB legacy artifact identified for cleanup. Compared to industry best practices, the system lacks explicit circuit breakers, query-aware contextualization, and RAG integration—representing opportunities for next-generation workflow efficiency.

## Research Reports Summary

### Report 001: /research Command - Current Implementation Analysis
**File**: `001_research_command_current_implementation.md`

The command implements 6 phases (topic decomposition → path pre-calculation → parallel agent invocation → verification → synthesis → cross-referencing) with full compliance to Standards 0, 11, and 12. Analysis identified 150+ lines of inline agent prompt templates (required per Standard 12 but contributing to 566-line total), 80 lines of verification checkpoints (critical for enforcement but with consolidation potential), and structural similarity to `/report` command (628 lines, 62-line delta from fallback creation block). No anti-pattern violations detected; agent invocations properly use imperative pattern without code fence wrappers.

### Report 002: .claude Infrastructure Analysis
**File**: `002_claude_infrastructure_analysis.md`

Infrastructure consists of 4 core libraries (topic-decomposition, artifact-creation, metadata-extraction, unified-location-detection) totaling 1,405 lines, plus 69 total library files system-wide. The research-specialist agent template is 670 lines with identified bloat: 179 lines of report file creation patterns (duplicate STEP 2-4 content), 73 lines of examples (consolidation opportunity), and 90 lines of completion criteria checklist (better suited for test validation). Legacy artifact-operations file (85KB) discovered but unused by `/research`. Metadata caching and lazy directory creation patterns demonstrate strong efficiency optimization, achieving 85% token reduction vs agent-based detection.

### Report 003: Workflow Efficiency Best Practices
**File**: `003_workflow_efficiency_best_practices.md`

2025 industry standards emphasize metadata-driven architectures (92-97% context reduction), hierarchical coordination with vertical hand-offs (vs chaotic peer chatter), and circuit breakers preventing agent spiraling. Best practices include progressive disclosure, sliding window context management, RAG for external knowledge access, and query-aware contextualization. Gap analysis reveals `/research` strengths (hierarchical delegation, metadata extraction, progressive disclosure) but missing: explicit token/time budgets, RAG integration, attention sink mechanisms, activated metadata as executable API, and streaming optimizations. Performance impact: hierarchical patterns offer 40-80% time savings through parallel subagent execution.

### Report 004: Performance Optimization Patterns
**File**: `004_performance_optimization_patterns.md`

Command demonstrates partial pattern adoption: unified location detection (fully adopted), metadata extraction (partial—synthesizer only), forward message (not used), context pruning (not used). Bloat analysis: agent invocation templates consume 164 lines (29% of command file), verification checkpoints repeated 4 times (120 lines total), path validation duplicated across command and agents. Bottleneck ranking identifies high-impact quick wins: extract agent invocation templates (40% prompt reduction, 2 hours effort), enforce metadata-only returns (20% context reduction, 1 hour), consolidate verification checkpoints (97% overhead reduction, 3 hours). Optimized performance projections: 340-line command (40% reduction), 2,740-line total context (23% reduction), 13 file I/O operations (30% reduction).

## Common Themes

### Theme 1: Template and Prompt Bloat (All Reports)
All four reports identify inline agent invocation templates as primary bloat source. Report 001 notes 150+ lines across 3 invocations (research-specialist, synthesizer, spec-updater), Report 002 identifies 670-line agent behavioral file with 252 lines of extractable content, Report 004 quantifies 164-line invocation template (29% of command file). Consensus: templates are structurally required per Standard 12 but should be externalized to `.claude/templates/agent-invocations/` for 40% command size reduction.

### Theme 2: Underutilized Performance Patterns (Reports 003, 004)
Reports 003 and 004 both identify missed opportunities in metadata extraction, forward message, and context pruning patterns. Report 004 notes research-specialist agents don't enforce metadata-only returns (allowing 200-500 token summaries), spec-updater reads N+1 full reports instead of receiving forwarded metadata (5-10KB each vs 200-300 bytes), and no explicit pruning after Step 4 verification retains 1,000-2,000 unnecessary tokens. Report 003 contextualizes this within 2025 best practices emphasizing progressive disclosure and selective attention mechanisms.

### Theme 3: Verification Checkpoint Redundancy (Reports 001, 004)
Both implementation analysis (001) and optimization patterns (004) highlight verification checkpoint overhead. Report 001 documents 3 MANDATORY VERIFICATION checkpoints consuming 80 lines total, Report 004 quantifies 4 checkpoints × 30 lines = 120 lines with 97% reduction potential via shared verification library. Consensus: checkpoints are critical for Standard 0 (Execution Enforcement) but should be abstracted to `.claude/lib/research-verification.sh` for consistency and maintainability.

### Theme 4: /research vs /report Duplication (Reports 001, 002)
Reports 001 and 002 identify structural similarity between `/research` (566 lines) and `/report` (628 lines) commands with 400+ lines of duplicate orchestration logic. Report 001 notes 62-line delta primarily from fallback creation block, Report 002 observes different libraries used (artifact-creation vs artifact-operations) but identical phase structures. Recommendation consensus: create shared `hierarchical-research-orchestration.sh` library to eliminate maintenance burden and reduce combined file size by 30-40%.

### Theme 5: Agent Behavioral File Optimization (Reports 002, 004)
Both infrastructure analysis (002) and performance patterns (004) identify agent behavioral file bloat. Report 002 quantifies research-specialist.md at 670 lines with 179 lines of report creation documentation (duplicate STEP 2-4), 73 lines of examples, and 90 lines of completion criteria. Report 004 notes 28-item checklist better suited for test validation and recommends 200-250 line reduction via template references. Combined agent context load: ~3,000 lines per invocation (4 research-specialist + 1 synthesizer).

### Theme 6: Missing Industry Best Practices (Report 003)
Report 003 uniquely identifies gaps vs 2025 industry standards: no explicit circuit breakers (token/time budgets to prevent agent spiraling), no RAG integration (retrieval-augmented generation for external knowledge), no attention sink mechanism (selective forgetting of low-priority outputs), metadata not "activated" as executable API (passive documentation vs active infrastructure), and limited streaming optimizations (batch processing dominant). These represent strategic opportunities for next-generation workflow efficiency beyond current bloat reduction.

## Prioritized Recommendations

### Critical/High Impact (Implement Immediately)

#### 1. Extract Agent Invocation Templates to Shared Directory
**Sources**: Reports 001, 004
**Impact**: 40% command prompt reduction (226 lines saved), improved maintainability
**Effort**: Low (2 hours)
**Implementation**: Create `.claude/templates/agent-invocations/` directory and extract lines 173-336 from research.md into separate template files (research-specialist.md, research-synthesizer.md, spec-updater.md). Update command to reference templates via `$(cat .claude/templates/...)` pattern.
**Expected Outcome**: Command file reduced from 566 to ~340 lines while maintaining Standard 12 compliance (structural templates remain accessible, not embedded in agent behavioral files).

#### 2. Consolidate Verification Checkpoints into Shared Library
**Sources**: Reports 001, 004
**Impact**: 97% verification overhead reduction (116 lines saved), standardized verification patterns
**Effort**: Low (3 hours)
**Implementation**: Create `.claude/lib/research-verification.sh` with functions `verify_research_paths()`, `verify_directory_exists()`, `verify_absolute_paths()`. Replace 4 checkpoint blocks (lines 100-107, 122-131, 148-171, 239-276) with single function calls.
**Expected Outcome**: Verification logic reduced from 120 lines inline to 4 function calls (4 lines), improved consistency across commands.

#### 3. Enforce Metadata-Only Return Pattern in Research-Specialist Agent
**Sources**: Reports 003, 004
**Impact**: 20% agent context reduction (600 tokens saved per agent), 2,400 tokens total
**Effort**: Low (1 hour)
**Implementation**: Add anti-pattern warning to research-specialist.md after line 198 explicitly prohibiting summary text in return format. Reference [Metadata Extraction Pattern](.claude/docs/concepts/patterns/metadata-extraction.md) and provide correct/incorrect examples.
**Expected Outcome**: Agents return only `REPORT_CREATED: [path]` format, eliminating 200-500 token summaries currently being generated.

### High Value/Medium Effort (Plan for Next Iteration)

#### 4. Harmonize /research and /report Commands via Shared Orchestration Library
**Sources**: Reports 001, 002
**Impact**: 30-40% maintenance burden reduction, elimination of 400+ lines duplicate logic
**Effort**: Medium (8 hours)
**Implementation**: Create `.claude/lib/hierarchical-research-orchestration.sh` with functions for each phase (topic_decomposition, path_precalculation, invoke_research_agents, verify_reports, synthesize_overview, update_cross_references). Both `/research` and `/report` become thin wrappers calling library functions with command-specific configuration.
**Expected Outcome**: Combined command file size reduced from 1,194 lines to ~400 lines (66% reduction), single source of truth for orchestration logic.

#### 5. Integrate Metadata Extraction Library in Cross-Reference Phase
**Sources**: Reports 003, 004
**Impact**: 30% file I/O reduction (5 fewer file operations), faster spec-updater invocation
**Effort**: Medium (4 hours)
**Implementation**: In Step 6 (lines 369-371), replace file path passing with metadata extraction using `extract_report_metadata()` from metadata-extraction.sh. Forward metadata objects to spec-updater instead of requiring agent to read N+1 full reports (5-10KB each → 200-300 bytes each).
**Expected Outcome**: Spec-updater receives pre-extracted metadata, eliminating redundant file reads and reducing context consumption by 25KB per invocation.

#### 6. Add Context Pruning After Verification Steps
**Sources**: Reports 003, 004
**Impact**: 10-15% context reduction (1,500 tokens saved), faster subsequent operations
**Effort**: Low (2 hours)
**Implementation**: Source `.claude/lib/context-pruning.sh` and call `prune_subagent_output()` after Step 4 verification (line 276). Prune full agent response content while retaining only paths for downstream operations.
**Expected Outcome**: Agent responses pruned after verification, reducing context window by 1,000-2,000 tokens for Steps 5-6.

#### 7. Streamline Agent Behavioral Files via Template References
**Sources**: Reports 002, 004
**Impact**: 8-10% agent context reduction (200-250 lines per agent), 400-500 lines total
**Effort**: Medium (8 hours)
**Implementation**: Extract report creation patterns (lines 417-595, 179 lines) to `.claude/templates/report-structure.md`, condense examples (lines 599-671, 73 lines) to 3-5 canonical patterns, consider moving completion criteria checklist (lines 322-411, 90 lines) to test validation.
**Expected Outcome**: research-specialist.md reduced from 670 to ~400 lines, agent context load reduced from ~3,000 to ~2,400 lines per invocation.

### Long-term/Strategic (Future Roadmap)

#### 8. Implement Circuit Breaker Mechanisms for Agent Spiraling Prevention
**Sources**: Report 003
**Impact**: Prevent runaway agent execution, improved reliability
**Effort**: High (12 hours)
**Implementation**: Add explicit token and time budgets to all hierarchical agent invocations. Supervisors enforce budget limits forcing subagents to conclude or yield before consuming excessive resources (Galileo best practice pattern).
**Expected Outcome**: Protection against agent spiraling scenarios, predictable resource consumption, graceful degradation under complexity pressure.

#### 9. Activate Metadata as Executable API Infrastructure
**Sources**: Report 003
**Impact**: Dynamic routing, dependency resolution, context assembly without manual intervention
**Effort**: High (16 hours)
**Implementation**: Transform metadata from passive documentation to active infrastructure. Implement metadata-driven routing, automatic dependency resolution, and context assembly patterns (Salesforce/Netflix pattern).
**Expected Outcome**: Metadata becomes executable API enabling 1 billion+ agent scenarios without manual configuration updates.

#### 10. Integrate RAG for External Knowledge Access
**Sources**: Report 003
**Impact**: Extended research beyond internal codebase, reduced upfront context loading
**Effort**: High (20 hours)
**Implementation**: Extend hierarchical research with retrieval-augmented generation to pull relevant external knowledge during research phases. Implement dynamic knowledge retrieval vs comprehensive context loading.
**Expected Outcome**: Research agents access external documentation, API references, and best practices without loading entire knowledge bases into context window.

#### 11. Add Query-Aware Contextualization for Dynamic Scope Adjustment
**Sources**: Report 003
**Impact**: Optimized context windows based on complexity signals, improved efficiency
**Effort**: High (16 hours)
**Implementation**: Implement dynamic scope adjustment where simple queries trigger minimal context loading and complex queries progressively expand context windows as needed. Use complexity signals from topic-decomposition.sh to drive context window sizing.
**Expected Outcome**: 20-40% average context reduction through adaptive context window management.

#### 12. Remove Legacy Infrastructure (artifact-operations-legacy.sh)
**Sources**: Report 002
**Impact**: 10% library bloat reduction (~85KB cleanup)
**Effort**: Low (1 hour)
**Implementation**: Verify no active commands source `artifact-operations-legacy.sh` using grep, then delete file and update library documentation.
**Expected Outcome**: Cleaner library directory, reduced maintenance surface, clear signal of deprecated patterns.
