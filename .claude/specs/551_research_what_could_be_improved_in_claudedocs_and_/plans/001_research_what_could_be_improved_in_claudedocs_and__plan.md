## Overview

This plan addresses critical gaps in command documentation identified through research analysis. The current documentation excels at describing anti-patterns and structural organization but lacks practical functional requirements that make commands actually work. This implementation will add missing library sourcing patterns, verification checkpoint implementations, error message structures, Phase 0 setup templates, quick-start guides, and quick-reference summaries.

**Goals**:
1. Add functional requirements documentation (library sourcing, verification, error handling)
2. Provide practical quick-start templates and step-by-step setup procedures
3. Create quick-reference sections with decision trees and common patterns
4. Integrate validation scripts and troubleshooting into development workflow
5. Establish clear boundaries between structural standards and behavioral content

## Research Summary

Brief synthesis of key findings from research reports:

**From Report 001 (Command Architecture Documentation)**:
- Library sourcing requirements are critical but undocumented (Phase 0 STEP 0 pattern)
- Verification checkpoint implementation patterns exist in /coordinate but not standardized
- Agent invocation pattern boundary unclear (inline template vs behavioral reference)
- Error message structure demonstrated in /coordinate but not documented as standard
- Phase 0 implementation pattern is conceptual only, not prescriptive
- Context pruning patterns are workflow-specific but lack implementation guidance

**From Report 002 (Command Development Guide)**:
- Missing quick-start template and command initialization procedure
- Library sourcing patterns not documented (order dependencies, verification)
- Verification checkpoints mentioned but not emphasized as MANDATORY
- Agent delegation troubleshooting not integrated into main workflow
- Validation scripts exist but not referenced in development guide
- Phase 0 setup pattern not templated despite 150-line consistency

**From Report 003 (Commands README)**:
- Library sourcing decision tree missing (when to use library-sourcing.sh vs direct)
- Imperative language requirements (Standard 0) not summarized
- Agent invocation patterns (Standard 11) not documented with examples
- Common setup patterns undocumented (path calculation, verification, fallback)
- Links to deep documentation incomplete
- README structure doesn't support quick-reference use case

**Recommended approach based on research**:
1. Create new command-functional-requirements.md for critical bootstrap patterns
2. Add quick-start section to command-development-guide.md with minimal templates
3. Integrate validation scripts into quality checklist workflow
4. Add "Command Developer Quick Reference" section to commands/README.md
5. Create decision trees and flowcharts for common scenarios
6. Link all documentation bidirectionally for discoverability

## Testing Strategy

### Overall Approach

**File Existence Validation**:
- All new documentation files created at expected paths
- No broken links (all cross-references valid)

**Content Completeness Validation**:
- All standards (F.1-F.3) documented with examples
- All decision trees present and complete
- All templates copy-paste ready
- All validation scripts referenced with usage examples

**Integration Testing**:
- Follow quick-start guide to create minimal working command
- Use Phase 0 template to bootstrap new orchestration command
- Apply decision trees to real scenarios (verify correct guidance)
- Run validation scripts referenced in documentation

**Cross-Reference Integrity**:
- All links bidirectional (if A links to B, B links back to A)
- All new guides linked from main indexes (README, command-development-guide.md)

### Test Commands

```bash
# Phase 1: Verify functional requirements documentation
test -f /home/benjamin/.config/.claude/docs/reference/command-functional-requirements.md
grep -c "^## Standard F\.[1-3]:" /home/benjamin/.config/.claude/docs/reference/command-functional-requirements.md

grep -c "| Field | Required | Purpose |" /home/benjamin/.config/.claude/commands/README.md

# Link integrity check (no broken links)
find /home/benjamin/.config/.claude/docs -name "*.md" -exec grep -l "\.md" {} \; | while read f; do
  grep -oE '\(\.\.?/[^)]+\.md[^)]*\)' "$f" | sed 's/[()]//g' | while read link; do
    target=$(dirname "$f")/"$link"
    [ -f "$target" ] || echo "BROKEN LINK in $f: $link"
  done
done
```

### Coverage Requirements

**Documentation Coverage**:
- All 6 critical gaps from research reports addressed
- All working patterns from /coordinate documented
- All validation scripts referenced
- All common pitfalls documented with solutions

**Usability Coverage**:
- Developer can create minimal working command in &lt;15 minutes using quick-start
- Developer can bootstrap orchestration command using Phase 0 template
- Developer can resolve common failures using decision trees and diagnostics

## Documentation Requirements

### Files to Create

1. `.claude/docs/reference/command-functional-requirements.md` - Standards F.1-F.3
2. `.claude/docs/guides/phase-0-implementation-guide.md` - Seven-step setup template
3. `.claude/docs/guides/context-pruning-guide.md` - Context management strategies
4. `.claude/docs/guides/template-vs-behavioral-distinction.md` - Inline vs reference decision tree

### Files to Update

1. `.claude/docs/reference/command_architecture_standards.md` - Add Part B, cross-references, decision trees
2. `.claude/docs/guides/command-development-guide.md` - Add quick-start, validation integration, decision trees
3. `.claude/commands/README.md` - Add quick-reference, frontmatter table, links, pitfalls

### Cross-Reference Updates

After creating new documentation:
- Update CLAUDE.md to reference new guides (if applicable)
- Update .claude/docs/README.md to index new files
- Ensure bidirectional linking between all related documentation

## Dependencies

### External Dependencies

**None** - All changes are documentation updates using existing working patterns

### Prerequisites

- Research reports completed (3 reports analyzing gaps)
- Access to working command examples (/coordinate, /supervise, /orchestrate)
- Validation scripts available in .claude/lib/

### Integration Points

- New standards integrate with existing Standards 0-12
- Quick-reference integrates with existing commands/README.md structure
- Validation scripts already exist, just need integration into workflow
- Templates extracted from production commands (/coordinate)

## Risk Management

### Technical Risks

**Risk 1: Documentation Becomes Outdated**
- Mitigation: Extract templates from working commands (stay synchronized)
- Mitigation: Use references to code rather than duplicating code in docs

**Risk 2: Over-Documentation (Too Much Detail)**
- Mitigation: Layered approach (quick-ref → guides → standards → patterns)
- Mitigation: Use "See Also" boxes rather than duplicating content

**Risk 3: Broken Links After Refactoring**
- Mitigation: Test all links after each phase
- Mitigation: Use relative paths consistently

### Process Risks

**Risk 1: Scope Creep (Adding Non-Essential Content)**
- Mitigation: Follow research reports exactly (only address identified gaps)
- Mitigation: Defer non-critical enhancements to future iterations

**Risk 2: Inconsistent Terminology**
- Mitigation: Use terminology from existing standards documents
- Mitigation: Create glossary if new terms introduced

## Notes

**Design Decisions**:
1. Create new command-functional-requirements.md rather than expanding command_architecture_standards.md to maintain clear separation between structural (what) and functional (how)
2. Extract templates from /coordinate (production-ready, 1,930 lines) rather than /orchestrate (experimental, 5,439 lines) for reliability
3. Use layered documentation (quick-ref → guides → standards) to support different developer needs
4. Integrate validation scripts into workflow rather than creating new validation tools

**Alternative Approaches Considered**:
1. ❌ Single comprehensive guide - Rejected due to length (would exceed 5,000 lines)
2. ❌ Inline all examples in standards document - Rejected due to duplication and maintenance burden
3. ✅ Layered documentation with cross-references - Selected for maintainability and usability

**Future Enhancements** (out of scope for this plan):
- Create interactive decision tree tool (web interface)
- Add video walkthroughs for quick-start procedures
- Create command generator script using templates
- Add automated link checking to CI/CD pipeline
