## Metadata
- **Date**: 2025-10-30
- **Agent**: research-specialist
- **Topic**: Command Architecture Documentation - Functional Requirements Gap Analysis
- **Report Type**: documentation analysis
- **Source File**: `/home/benjamin/.config/.claude/docs/reference/command_architecture_standards.md`
- **Comparison File**: `/home/benjamin/.config/.claude/commands/coordinate.md`

## Executive Summary

The Command Architecture Standards document provides excellent guidance on structural patterns, anti-patterns, and code organization, but has significant gaps in documenting the **functional requirements** that make commands actually work. Analysis of the working /coordinate command reveals critical functional patterns (library sourcing, verification checkpoints, error handling structures) that are missing or under-documented in the standards. The document excels at "what not to do" (anti-patterns, refactoring guidelines) but lacks concrete "what you must do" guidance for implementing working commands.

## Key Findings

### 1. Library Sourcing Requirements (CRITICAL GAP)

**Gap Identified**: Standards document does not specify library sourcing as a mandatory functional requirement.

**What's Missing**:
- **No mention of library sourcing order** (must occur before any function calls)
- **No specification of required libraries** by command type
- **No guidance on error handling** when libraries missing
- **No mention of library-sourcing.sh** utility pattern
- **No verification checkpoints** for library loading

**Evidence from /coordinate**:
- Lines 523-570: Complete library sourcing implementation with STEP 0 enforcement
- Lines 527-538: Uses library-sourcing.sh utility for centralized loading
- Lines 541-543: Explicit error handling when libraries missing
- Lines 547-569: Verification that critical functions are defined after sourcing
- Line 510: Section marker: `[EXECUTION-CRITICAL: Library sourcing MUST occur before any function calls]`

**Working Pattern in /coordinate**:
```bash
# Phase 0 STEP 0: Source Required Libraries (MUST BE FIRST)
if [ -f "$SCRIPT_DIR/../lib/library-sourcing.sh" ]; then
  source "$SCRIPT_DIR/../lib/library-sourcing.sh"
else
  echo "ERROR: Required library not found: library-sourcing.sh"
  exit 1
fi

# Source all required libraries with validation
if ! source_required_libraries "dependency-analyzer.sh" "context-pruning.sh" ...; then
  exit 1
fi

# Verify critical functions are defined
REQUIRED_FUNCTIONS=(detect_workflow_scope should_run_phase emit_progress ...)
for func in "${REQUIRED_FUNCTIONS[@]}"; do
  if ! command -v "$func" >/dev/null 2>&1; then
    MISSING_FUNCTIONS+=("$func")
  fi
done
```

**Impact**: Commands without proper library sourcing fail silently or have undefined function errors. This is a **bootstrap requirement** that must be documented as Standard 0.1 or similar.

**Recommendation**: Add new standard documenting:
1. Library sourcing MUST occur in Phase 0 STEP 0
2. Required libraries by command type (orchestration, implementation, testing)
3. Error handling pattern when libraries missing
4. Function verification pattern after sourcing
5. Export pattern for making functions available to subshells

---

### 2. Verification Checkpoint Implementation (PARTIAL DOCUMENTATION)

**Gap Identified**: Standards mention verification checkpoints conceptually (Standard 0) but don't document the **implementation patterns** used in working commands.

**What's Documented**:
- Lines 102-130 in standards: Generic verification checkpoint pattern
- Conceptual requirement to verify file existence

**What's Missing**:
- **Helper function pattern** for concise verification (verify_file_created)
- **Silent success / verbose failure** pattern
- **Verification loop pattern** for multiple artifacts
- **Integration with progress markers** (emit_progress after verification)
- **Fail-fast vs continue patterns** (when to exit 1 vs continue)
- **Diagnostic information structure** (what to include in error output)

**Evidence from /coordinate**:
- Lines 747-813: Complete helper function implementation with inline documentation
- Lines 771-810: Sophisticated verification with silent success ("✓") and verbose failure
- Lines 785-807: Diagnostic information structure including directory status, file count, recent files
- Lines 909-940: Verification loop pattern for multiple research reports
- Lines 925-934: Partial failure handling (≥50% success threshold)

**Working Pattern in /coordinate**:
```bash
# Define helper function with silent success, verbose failure
verify_file_created() {
  local file_path="$1"
  local item_desc="$2"
  local phase_name="$3"

  if [ -f "$file_path" ] && [ -s "$file_path" ]; then
    echo -n "✓"  # Success - single character, no newline
    return 0
  else
    # Failure - verbose diagnostic
    echo ""
    echo "✗ ERROR [$phase_name]: $item_desc verification failed"
    echo "   Expected: File exists at $file_path"
    [ ! -f "$file_path" ] && echo "   Found: File does not exist" || echo "   Found: File empty (0 bytes)"
    echo ""
    echo "DIAGNOSTIC INFORMATION:"
    echo "  - Expected path: $file_path"
    echo "  - Parent directory: $(dirname "$file_path")"
    # [directory status checks, file listing, suggested commands]
    return 1
  fi
}

# Usage in verification loop
echo -n "Verifying research reports ($RESEARCH_COMPLEXITY): "
for i in $(seq 1 $RESEARCH_COMPLEXITY); do
  if ! verify_file_created "$REPORT_PATH" "Research report $i/$RESEARCH_COMPLEXITY" "Phase 1"; then
    VERIFICATION_FAILURES=$((VERIFICATION_FAILURES + 1))
  fi
done
```

**Impact**: Without documented verification patterns, commands either skip verification (causing downstream failures) or implement inconsistent verification that produces unclear error messages.

**Recommendation**: Expand Standard 0 to include subsection "Standard 0.2: Verification Checkpoint Implementation" with:
1. Helper function pattern for reusable verification
2. Silent success / verbose failure output pattern
3. Diagnostic information structure specification
4. Verification loop patterns for single vs multiple artifacts
5. Partial failure handling guidance (when to continue vs exit)
6. Integration with progress markers and checkpoint saves

---

### 3. Agent Invocation Pattern vs Template Distinction (UNCLEAR BOUNDARY)

**Gap Identified**: Standard 11 (Imperative Agent Invocation) and Standard 12 (Structural vs Behavioral Separation) create confusion about what must be inline vs what can be referenced.

**Conflicting Guidance**:
- **Standard 11 (lines 1128-1307)**: Requires complete Task invocation templates inline with imperative instructions
- **Standard 12 (lines 1310-1397)**: Prohibits behavioral content duplication, requires referencing agent files
- **Ambiguity**: Where is the line between "structural template" (must be inline) and "behavioral content" (must be referenced)?

**What's Missing**:
- **Clear decision tree** for inline vs reference
- **Concrete examples** showing the boundary
- **Placeholder substitution pattern** documentation
- **Context injection pattern** specification

**Evidence from /coordinate**:
- Lines 876-896: Agent invocation with placeholder substitution pattern
- Lines 877-878: Structural template (Task { ... }) inline
- Line 880: Behavioral reference ("Read and follow ALL behavioral guidelines from:")
- Lines 887-889: Context injection with placeholders `[substitute $RESEARCH_COMPLEXITY value]`
- Lines 890-894: Return value specification (completion signal requirement)

**Working Pattern in /coordinate**:
```
**EXECUTE NOW**: USE the Task tool NOW to invoke the research-specialist agent for EACH research topic.

**YOUR RESPONSIBILITY**: Make N Task tool invocations (one per topic from 1 to $RESEARCH_COMPLEXITY) by substituting actual values for placeholders below.

Task {
  subagent_type: "general-purpose"
  description: "Research [substitute actual topic name] with mandatory artifact creation"
  timeout: 300000
  prompt: "
    Read and follow ALL behavioral guidelines from:
    /home/benjamin/.config/.claude/agents/research-specialist.md

    **Workflow-Specific Context**:
    - Research Topic: [substitute actual topic name from research topics list]
    - Report Path: [substitute REPORT_PATHS[$i-1] for this topic where $i is 1 to $RESEARCH_COMPLEXITY]
    - Project Standards: /home/benjamin/.config/CLAUDE.md
    - Complexity Level: [substitute $RESEARCH_COMPLEXITY value]

    **CRITICAL**: Create report file at EXACT path provided above.

    Execute research following all guidelines in behavioral file.
    Return: REPORT_CREATED: [exact absolute path to report file]
  "
}
```

**Key Pattern Elements**:
1. **Imperative instruction** precedes template (YOUR RESPONSIBILITY: Make N Task tool invocations)
2. **Structural template** inline (Task block structure)
3. **Behavioral reference** (Read and follow ALL behavioral guidelines from:)
4. **Context injection section** with placeholders (bracketed substitution instructions)
5. **Completion signal requirement** (Return: REPORT_CREATED:)

**Impact**: Without clear boundary documentation, developers either:
- Duplicate behavioral content inline (violates Standard 12, causes maintenance burden)
- Reference too much (violates Standard 11, breaks execution)

**Recommendation**: Create new guidance document "Template vs Behavioral Distinction" with:
1. Decision tree: "Is this structural (inline) or behavioral (reference)?"
2. Placeholder substitution pattern documentation
3. Context injection vs behavioral duplication examples
4. Before/after examples showing correct boundary
5. Integration with Standards 11 and 12 (clarify relationship)

---

### 4. Error Message Structure Documentation (EXCELLENT BUT INCOMPLETE)

**Gap Identified**: /coordinate demonstrates sophisticated error message structure (lines 292-311) but standards don't document this as a required pattern.

**What's Documented**:
- Standard 0 mentions error handling conceptually
- Lines 941-944 in standards: Basic error handling with recovery suggestions

**What's Missing**:
- **Required error message structure** (header, diagnostic info, what to check next, example commands)
- **Diagnostic information specification** (what must be included)
- **Multi-level error detail** pattern (brief summary → detailed diagnostic → suggested actions)
- **Example command inclusion** requirement

**Evidence from /coordinate**:
- Lines 292-311: Complete error message structure specification
- Lines 295-300: Three-level structure (ERROR/Expected/Found, DIAGNOSTIC INFORMATION, What to check next, Example commands)
- Lines 782-807: Implementation in verify_file_created helper
- Lines 611-627: Implementation in workflow description validation

**Working Pattern in /coordinate**:
```
❌ ERROR: [What failed]
   Expected: [What was supposed to happen]
   Found: [What actually happened]

DIAGNOSTIC INFORMATION:
  - [Specific check that failed]
  - [File system state or error details]
  - [Why this might have happened]

What to check next:
  1. [First debugging step]
  2. [Second debugging step]
  3. [Third debugging step]

Example commands to debug:
  ls -la [path]
  cat [file]
  grep [pattern] [file]
```

**Impact**: Inconsistent error messages across commands make debugging harder. Some commands provide cryptic errors, others provide helpful diagnostics.

**Recommendation**: Add Standard 0.3 "Error Message Structure Requirements":
1. Three-level structure specification (ERROR/DIAGNOSTIC/ACTIONS)
2. Required diagnostic information by error type
3. Example command inclusion pattern
4. Integration with error-handling.sh library functions
5. Before/after examples showing improvement

---

### 5. Phase 0 Implementation Pattern (DOCUMENTED BUT NOT AS MANDATORY)

**Gap Identified**: Standard 0 documents Phase 0 conceptually (lines 308-417) but doesn't mandate the specific implementation pattern used by working commands.

**What's Documented**:
- Lines 308-370: Phase 0 concept (orchestrator vs executor roles)
- Lines 339-369: Example Phase 0 implementation
- Lines 408-416: When Phase 0 is required

**What's Missing**:
- **Mandatory step structure** (STEP 0: Libraries, STEP 1: Arguments, STEP 2: Scope, STEP 3: Paths)
- **Function consolidation pattern** (initialize_workflow_paths utility)
- **Export pattern for subshell access** (export WORKFLOW_SCOPE PHASES_TO_EXECUTE)
- **Progress marker integration** (emit_progress at phase boundaries)
- **Checkpoint restoration pattern** (auto-resume capability)

**Evidence from /coordinate**:
- Lines 508-746: Complete Phase 0 implementation across 7 steps
- Lines 523-605: STEP 0 (libraries), STEP 1 (arguments), STEP 2 (scope)
- Lines 682-744: STEP 3 (paths) using initialize_workflow_paths consolidation
- Lines 631-645: Checkpoint restoration pattern for auto-resume
- Lines 654-675: Workflow scope to phase mapping

**Working Pattern in /coordinate**:
```bash
# Phase 0: Project Location and Path Pre-Calculation

### STEP 0: Source Required Libraries (MUST BE FIRST)
[library sourcing with verification]
emit_progress "0" "Libraries loaded and verified"

### STEP 1: Parse workflow description from command arguments
WORKFLOW_DESCRIPTION="$1"
[argument validation with usage message]

### STEP 2: Detect workflow scope
WORKFLOW_SCOPE=$(detect_workflow_scope "$WORKFLOW_DESCRIPTION")
[scope to phase mapping]
export WORKFLOW_SCOPE PHASES_TO_EXECUTE SKIP_PHASES

### STEP 3: Initialize workflow paths using consolidated function
[unified path calculation]
emit_progress "0" "Location pre-calculation complete (topic: $TOPIC_PATH)"
```

**Seven-Step Pattern**:
1. STEP 0: Library sourcing + verification
2. STEP 1: Argument parsing + validation
3. STEP 2: Workflow scope detection + phase mapping
4. STEP 3: Unified path initialization
5. (STEPs 4-7 consolidated into initialize_workflow_paths in /coordinate)

**Impact**: Commands without structured Phase 0 have bootstrap failures, inconsistent path calculations, or missing library functions.

**Recommendation**: Transform Phase 0 guidance from conceptual to prescriptive:
1. Mandatory step structure (STEP 0-3 minimum)
2. Function consolidation pattern for path initialization
3. Export pattern specification
4. Progress marker integration requirement
5. Checkpoint restoration pattern (if resumable workflow)
6. Template code blocks showing each step

---

### 6. Context Pruning Documentation (CONCEPTUAL ONLY)

**Gap Identified**: Standards mention context pruning (lines 398-406) but don't document the **implementation patterns** for when and how to prune.

**What's Documented**:
- Line 327 in standards: Brief mention of "context pruning" in library list
- Lines 1175-1181 in standards: Context pruning mentioned in Phase 2 completion
- No specification of when to prune, what to prune, or how to implement

**What's Missing**:
- **Pruning checkpoint pattern** (after each phase completion)
- **What to prune vs what to keep** decision criteria
- **Workflow-specific pruning policies** (research-only vs full-implementation)
- **Integration with checkpoint saves** (prune before or after checkpoint?)
- **Metadata extraction vs full content** pattern

**Evidence from /coordinate**:
- Lines 1025-1035: Phase 1 context pruning with metadata storage
- Lines 1174-1184: Phase 2 context pruning with workflow-specific policy
- Lines 1388-1399: Phase 3 aggressive pruning of wave metadata
- Lines 1501-1506: Phase 4 selective pruning (keep test output for potential debugging)
- Lines 1677-1686: Phase 5 final pruning after debugging complete

**Working Pattern in /coordinate**:
```bash
# After Phase N completes:

# 1. Store minimal phase metadata
store_phase_metadata "phase_N" "complete" "$ARTIFACT_SUMMARY"

# 2. Apply workflow-specific pruning policy
apply_pruning_policy "phase_type" "$WORKFLOW_SCOPE"

# 3. Report context reduction
echo "Phase N metadata stored (context reduction: 80-90%)"

# 4. Emit progress marker
emit_progress "N" "Phase N complete"
```

**Decision Criteria in /coordinate**:
- **Phase 1**: Store artifact paths only, no pruning yet (research needed for planning)
- **Phase 2**: Prune research if workflow is research-and-plan (plan complete, no implementation)
- **Phase 3**: Aggressive pruning of wave details, keep summary only
- **Phase 4**: Keep test output (might need for debugging in Phase 5)
- **Phase 5**: Prune test output after debugging complete
- **Phase 6**: Final pruning, keep only artifact paths

**Impact**: Commands without context pruning guidelines either:
- Never prune (context bloat, hitting limits)
- Prune too aggressively (lose needed context for later phases)
- Prune inconsistently (unpredictable context usage)

**Recommendation**: Add "Context Pruning Implementation Guide" with:
1. Checkpoint pattern: when to prune (after each phase)
2. Decision criteria: what to keep vs discard by phase
3. Workflow-specific policies (research-only, plan-only, full-implementation)
4. Integration with checkpoint saves
5. Metadata extraction pattern (store summary, discard details)
6. Context measurement utilities (track reduction percentages)

## Root Cause Analysis

The Command Architecture Standards document was created to address **structural anti-patterns** (over-extraction, reference-only sections) identified after refactoring damage (commit 40b9146). This reactive origin explains why it excels at:

1. **What not to do** (anti-patterns, 40% of document)
2. **Structural organization** (directory structure, file size guidelines)
3. **Refactoring safeguards** (testing standards, review checklists)

However, it lacks **proactive functional requirements** because it was written from the perspective of "prevent damage" rather than "enable construction."

**Evidence**:
- Lines 6-7: "Derived From: Refactoring damage analysis (commit 40b9146)"
- Lines 1943-1981: Large section on "Bad Example: Broken /orchestrate" with restoration targets
- Lines 1525-1666: Extensive anti-pattern documentation

The document assumes readers already know how to build working commands and just need to avoid breaking them during refactoring. It doesn't guide someone building a new command from scratch.

## Recommendations

### Priority 1: Critical Functional Requirements (IMMEDIATE)

**Create new document**: `.claude/docs/reference/command-functional-requirements.md`

Must document:
1. **Library Sourcing** (Standard F.1)
   - Mandatory STEP 0 pattern
   - Required libraries by command type
   - Verification pattern
   - Error handling when libraries missing

2. **Verification Checkpoints** (Standard F.2)
   - Helper function pattern (verify_file_created)
   - Silent success / verbose failure
   - Verification loop patterns
   - Fail-fast vs continue decision criteria

3. **Error Message Structure** (Standard F.3)
   - Three-level structure (ERROR/DIAGNOSTIC/ACTIONS)
   - Required diagnostic information
   - Example command inclusion
   - Integration with error-handling.sh

### Priority 2: Pattern Implementation Guides (NEXT SPRINT)

**Create new documents**:

1. `.claude/docs/guides/phase-0-implementation-guide.md`
   - Seven-step mandatory structure
   - Function consolidation pattern
   - Export pattern for subshell access
   - Checkpoint restoration pattern

2. `.claude/docs/guides/context-pruning-guide.md`
   - When to prune (after each phase)
   - What to prune by workflow type
   - Metadata extraction pattern
   - Integration with checkpoints

3. `.claude/docs/guides/template-vs-behavioral-distinction.md`
   - Decision tree for inline vs reference
   - Placeholder substitution pattern
   - Context injection specification
   - Integration with Standards 11 and 12

### Priority 3: Standards Clarification (ONGOING)

**Update existing standards document**:

1. **Restructure into two parts**:
   - Part A: Structural Standards (existing content)
   - Part B: Functional Requirements (new, link to detailed guides)

2. **Add cross-references**:
   - Standard 0 → Link to command-functional-requirements.md
   - Standard 11 → Link to template-vs-behavioral-distinction.md
   - Standard 12 → Link to template-vs-behavioral-distinction.md

3. **Create decision tree section**:
   - "When do I inline vs reference?"
   - "When do I verify vs trust?"
   - "When do I prune vs keep?"

### Priority 4: Working Examples Repository (LONG-TERM)

**Create**: `.claude/docs/examples/working-command-patterns/`

Include:
1. `/coordinate` as reference implementation (2,500 lines, production-ready)
2. Annotated extracts showing each functional requirement
3. Before/after refactoring examples
4. Common mistakes and corrections

## Validation Checklist

To validate these recommendations, test documentation with these scenarios:

- [ ] Can a developer build a new orchestration command using only the documentation?
- [ ] Does the documentation explain WHY /coordinate works (not just WHAT it does)?
- [ ] Are functional requirements as clear as structural anti-patterns?
- [ ] Can someone debug a broken command using the diagnostic patterns?
- [ ] Do the guides reference working examples from production commands?
