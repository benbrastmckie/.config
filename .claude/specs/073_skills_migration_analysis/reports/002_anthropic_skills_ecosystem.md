# Research Report: Anthropic Claude Code Skills Ecosystem

**Report ID**: 002_anthropic_skills_ecosystem
**Topic**: Official Claude Code Skills from Anthropic
**Date**: 2025-10-23
**Status**: Complete

## Executive Summary

Anthropic launched the Claude Skills system on October 16, 2025, introducing a powerful extensibility mechanism for Claude AI across all platforms (Claude.ai, Claude Code CLI, and API). Skills are modular, discoverable packages containing instructions, scripts, and resources that Claude autonomously invokes when relevant to user tasks. Unlike slash commands or traditional plugins, Skills use a "progressive disclosure" architecture—Claude scans available skills, identifies relevant matches based on YAML metadata, and loads only the minimal information needed, keeping interactions fast while accessing specialized expertise.

The official skills ecosystem includes 15+ pre-built skills spanning creative design, document manipulation, enterprise communication, and development workflows. Skills achieve dramatic performance improvements in real-world deployments: Rakuten reports reducing day-long accounting tasks to one hour, while enterprises like Box, Notion, and Canva leverage skills to capture organizational context and streamline domain-specific workflows.

**Key Finding**: Skills represent a fundamental shift from user-invoked commands to AI-invoked capabilities, enabling true agentic behavior where Claude autonomously composes multiple skills to solve complex tasks.

## Architecture Overview

### Core Design Principles

**Model-Invoked Extensibility**: Skills differ fundamentally from slash commands. While commands require explicit user invocation (e.g., `/plan`), Skills are autonomously activated by Claude based on task relevance. Claude analyzes user requests, matches them against skill descriptions in YAML frontmatter, and dynamically loads skills when beneficial.

**Progressive Disclosure**: Each skill consumes only "a few dozen tokens" in its dormant state. When activated, Claude loads only the specific files and sections needed for the current task. This architecture prevents context window bloat while enabling access to vast specialized knowledge bases.

**Composability**: Skills automatically coordinate when multiple are needed. Claude can invoke document-creation skills alongside brand-guideline skills, composing complex workflows without explicit orchestration logic.

**Portability**: Skills work identically across Claude.ai web interface, Claude Code CLI, and the Messages API. A single skill definition deploys to all platforms.

### Skill Structure

Every skill consists of a required `SKILL.md` file plus optional supporting resources:

```
skill-name/
├── SKILL.md           (required: YAML frontmatter + instructions)
├── reference.md       (optional: detailed documentation)
├── scripts/           (optional: executable code)
│   ├── process.py
│   └── transform.js
└── templates/         (optional: reusable content)
    ├── report.md
    └── config.json
```

**SKILL.md Format**: The core skill definition requires YAML frontmatter with three fields:

```yaml
---
name: skill-name-format
description: "Clear description of what this skill does and when Claude should use it"
allowed-tools: Read, Grep, Bash
---

# Skill Instructions

Detailed markdown instructions that Claude follows when this skill is active.
Include examples, constraints, and workflows here.
```

**Field Requirements**:
- `name`: Lowercase letters, numbers, hyphens only (max 64 characters)
- `description`: Brief explanation for Claude's skill-matching algorithm (max 1024 characters)
- `allowed-tools`: Optional comma-separated list restricting which Claude Code tools can be used (e.g., `Read, Grep, Glob`)

The `allowed-tools` field provides security-conscious workflows by limiting tool access—a read-only analysis skill might specify `allowed-tools: Read, Grep` to prevent file modifications.

### Installation Locations

Skills install in three scopes:

1. **Personal Skills**: `~/.claude/skills/skill-name/SKILL.md`
   User-specific skills available across all projects

2. **Project Skills**: `.claude/skills/skill-name/SKILL.md`
   Project-scoped skills that sync via version control to team members

3. **Plugin Skills**: Bundled within Claude Code plugins
   Marketplace-distributed skills installed via `/plugin install`

The official skills repository registers as a plugin: `/plugin install document-skills@anthropic-agent-skills` installs all Anthropic document manipulation skills.

### Execution Environment

Skills run in Claude's code execution sandbox with key constraints:

- **No Network Access**: Skills cannot make HTTP requests or access external APIs
- **No Runtime Installation**: Cannot install packages during execution (dependencies must be pre-included)
- **File Size Limits**: 8MB maximum for custom skill uploads via API
- **Tool Restrictions**: Can limit available tools via `allowed-tools` frontmatter field

Skills can include executable code (Python, JavaScript, etc.) for tasks where deterministic programming is more reliable than token generation—for example, spreadsheet formula calculations or PDF text extraction.

## Performance Impact & Real-World Adoption

**Efficiency Gains**: Rakuten reports "what once took a day, we can now accomplish in an hour" through skills-powered accounting and finance workflows. The efficiency stems from combining specialized domain knowledge with deterministic code execution for tasks like spreadsheet manipulation and document generation.

**Enterprise Adoption**:
- **Box**: Transforms stored files into presentations and spreadsheets following organizational standards
- **Notion**: Enables seamless content transformation with more predictable, on-brand results
- **Canva**: Customizes design agents for workflows capturing unique organizational context

**Context Efficiency**: Progressive disclosure keeps skills dormant at ~20-40 tokens each until invoked, enabling Claude to maintain awareness of 20+ skills while consuming <1000 tokens—less than 1% of typical context windows.

**Composability Benefits**: Claude automatically coordinates multiple skills for complex tasks. A request like "Create a branded quarterly report presentation" might invoke `xlsx` (data), `pptx` (presentation), and `brand-guidelines` (styling) skills in sequence without explicit orchestration.

## Skill Development Best Practices

Based on official documentation and example skills:

1. **Clear Descriptions**: The `description` field is Claude's primary skill-matching signal. Be specific about use cases and triggers.

2. **Progressive Complexity**: Structure instructions from simple to complex. Claude loads content progressively—put essential guidance first.

3. **Include Examples**: Concrete examples in instructions significantly improve execution quality.

4. **Leverage Code Execution**: For deterministic tasks (calculations, parsing, format conversion), include executable scripts rather than relying on token generation.

5. **Restrict Tools Appropriately**: Use `allowed-tools` to limit scope and improve security for sensitive workflows.

6. **Version Control Project Skills**: Commit `.claude/skills/` to git for team synchronization and version history.

7. **Reference Documentation Externally**: Use `reference.md` for detailed documentation that Claude loads only when needed, keeping main instructions concise.
