# Context Window Protection Strategies

## Executive Summary

Context window protection is achieved through five core strategies: metadata-only passing (99% reduction), forward message pattern (eliminates paraphrasing overhead), aggressive context pruning (80-90% reduction), layered context architecture, and checkpoint-based external state storage. These strategies enable complex multi-phase workflows to maintain <30% context usage throughout execution. The hierarchical agent architecture demonstrates that proper delegation with metadata extraction reduces supervisor context from 20,000+ tokens (4 agents × 5,000 tokens each) to 1,000 tokens (4 agents × 250 tokens each), enabling 10+ parallel agents versus 2-3 without these protections.

## Research Methodology

This research analyzed the following primary sources from the .claude/docs/ directory:
- `concepts/patterns/metadata-extraction.md` - Core metadata extraction patterns
- `concepts/patterns/context-management.md` - Comprehensive context management techniques
- `concepts/patterns/forward-message.md` - No-paraphrase handoff patterns
- `concepts/hierarchical_agents.md` - Multi-level agent coordination architecture
- `commands/orchestrate.md` - Real-world implementation examples

## Core Protection Strategies

### Strategy 1: Metadata-Only Passing

**Definition**: Extract and pass only condensed metadata (title + 50-word summary + key references) instead of full artifact content between agents and workflow phases.

**Mechanism**:
```markdown
Agent completes task and creates artifact (5,000-10,000 tokens)
    ↓
Agent returns ONLY metadata structure:
{
  "artifact_path": "/absolute/path/to/artifact.md",
  "title": "Extracted from first # heading",
  "summary": "First 50 words from Executive Summary",
  "key_findings": ["Finding 1", "Finding 2", "Finding 3"],
  "recommendations": ["Top recommendation 1", "Top recommendation 2"],
  "file_paths": ["/path/to/referenced/file1.sh"]
}
    ↓
Supervisor receives metadata (200-300 tokens)
    ↓
Context reduction: 95-99% (5,000 tokens → 250 tokens)
```

**Quantified Impact**:
- Per-artifact reduction: 5,000 tokens → 250 tokens (95% reduction)
- 4 parallel agents: 20,000 tokens → 1,000 tokens (95% reduction)
- Hierarchical supervision (3 levels): 60,000 tokens → 3,000 tokens (95% reduction)

**Implementation Reference**:
- Utility: `.claude/lib/metadata-extraction.sh::extract_report_metadata()`
- Pattern documentation: `.claude/docs/concepts/patterns/metadata-extraction.md`
- Real-world usage: `/orchestrate` command research phase (4 parallel agents)

**Anti-Pattern to Avoid**:
```markdown
❌ BAD - Returning full content:
## Research Complete

Here's my full research report:
# OAuth 2.0 Authentication Patterns
[5,000 tokens of full report content]

Result: 5,000 tokens per agent, supervisor limited to 4 agents maximum
```

### Strategy 2: Forward Message Pattern

**Definition**: Pass subagent responses directly to subsequent phases without re-summarizing, paraphrasing, or interpreting the content.

**Mechanism**:
```markdown
✓ GOOD - Direct forwarding (0 additional tokens):
## Research Phase Complete

FORWARDING RESEARCH RESULTS:
{metadata from agent 1}
{metadata from agent 2}
{metadata from agent 3}

Proceeding to planning phase.

Total overhead: 50 tokens (headers + transition)

---

❌ BAD - Re-summarization (+500 tokens):
Based on the research findings, the key points are...
[Supervisor paraphrases metadata unnecessarily]

Total overhead: 550 tokens (50 transition + 500 paraphrasing)
```

**Quantified Impact**:
- Token overhead per agent forwarded:
  - Forward message: 0-10 tokens (transition text only)
  - Re-summarization: 100-300 tokens (paraphrasing)
  - Interpretation injection: 200-500 tokens (analysis + paraphrasing)
- Multi-agent workflows (4 agents):
  - With forward message: 40 tokens overhead (4 × 10)
  - With re-summarization: 800 tokens overhead (4 × 200)
  - Savings: 760 tokens (95% reduction)

**Implementation Reference**:
- Pattern documentation: `.claude/docs/concepts/patterns/forward-message.md`
- Real-world usage: `/orchestrate` command transitions between phases

**Anti-Pattern to Avoid**:
```markdown
❌ BAD - Unnecessary paraphrasing:
Subagent: "PKCE flow prevents authorization code interception"
Supervisor: "The research strongly recommends PKCE flow due to its critical
security benefits in preventing code theft, which is a major vulnerability."

Problems:
1. "strongly recommends" (interpretation) vs factual statement
2. Added 40 tokens of unnecessary paraphrasing
3. Lost precision from original metadata
```

### Strategy 3: Aggressive Context Pruning

**Definition**: Remove completed phase data from context after metadata extraction, retaining only artifact paths and essential metadata.

**Mechanism**:
```markdown
## Phase Completion Cleanup

After Phase N completes:

1. Extract metadata from phase results (250 tokens)
2. Store metadata in checkpoint file
3. PRUNE full phase content from context:
   - Remove agent full responses
   - Remove intermediate calculations
   - Remove verbose logs
4. Retain only:
   - Phase metadata (100-200 tokens)
   - Artifact paths
   - Critical errors/warnings

Result: Phase N reduced from 5,000 tokens to 200 tokens (96% reduction)
```

**Quantified Impact**:
- Per-phase reduction: 5,000 tokens → 200 tokens (96% reduction)
- 7-phase workflow without pruning: 35,000 tokens (140% overflow)
- 7-phase workflow with pruning: 7,000 tokens (28% context usage)

**Pruning Policies by Workflow Type**:

**Aggressive Pruning** (orchestration workflows):
- Target: <20% context usage
- Prunes: Full subagent outputs after metadata extraction, completed phase data after phase transitions, intermediate artifacts
- Retains: Artifact paths only, 50-word summaries, workflow status
- Best for: `/orchestrate`, multi-agent research, complex workflows
- Context reduction: 90-95%

**Moderate Pruning** (implementation workflows):
- Target: 20-30% context usage
- Prunes: Subagent outputs after metadata extraction, test outputs after validation, build logs after successful build
- Retains: Recent phase metadata (last 2 phases), current phase full context, error messages from failures
- Best for: `/implement`, `/plan`, `/debug`
- Context reduction: 70-85%

**Minimal Pruning** (single-agent workflows):
- Target: 30-50% context usage
- Prunes: Only explicitly marked temporary data, large artifacts after reading
- Retains: Most workflow context, agent outputs, recent operations
- Best for: `/document`, `/refactor`, `/test`
- Context reduction: 40-60%

**Implementation Reference**:
- Utility: `.claude/lib/context-pruning.sh`
- Functions: `prune_subagent_output()`, `prune_phase_metadata()`, `apply_pruning_policy()`
- Pattern documentation: `.claude/docs/concepts/patterns/context-management.md`

### Strategy 4: Layered Context Architecture

**Definition**: Organize context into layers with different retention policies based on importance and lifecycle.

**Layer Structure**:
```markdown
Layer 1: Permanent (always retained)
- User request
- Workflow type
- Current phase
- Critical errors
Total: 500-1,000 tokens

Layer 2: Phase-Scoped (retained during phase, pruned after)
- Current phase instructions
- Agent invocations for this phase
- Verification checkpoints
Total: 2,000-4,000 tokens per phase

Layer 3: Metadata (retained between phases)
- Artifact paths
- Phase summaries
- Key findings
Total: 200-300 tokens per phase

Layer 4: Transient (pruned immediately after use)
- Full agent responses
- Detailed logs
- Intermediate calculations
Total: 0 tokens (pruned before next phase)

Context Budget Example (6 phases):
- Layer 1: 1,000 tokens (4%)
- Layer 2: 3,000 tokens (12%) - current phase only
- Layer 3: 1,500 tokens (6%) - 5 completed phases × 300 tokens
- Layer 4: 0 tokens (pruned)
Total: 5,500 tokens (22% context usage across 6 phases)
```

**Quantified Impact**:
- Without layering: All data treated equally, cannot selectively prune, 40,000+ tokens (160% overflow)
- With layering: Selective retention by importance, 5,500 tokens (22% context usage)
- Reduction: 86% reduction in total context usage

**Implementation Reference**:
- Pattern documentation: `.claude/docs/concepts/patterns/context-management.md`
- Real-world usage: `/orchestrate` command workflow state management

### Strategy 5: Checkpoint-Based External State Storage

**Definition**: Store workflow state externally in checkpoint files, loading only needed metadata on-demand rather than keeping full state in context.

**Mechanism**:
```markdown
## Checkpoint Strategy

After each phase:
1. Write checkpoint file: .claude/data/checkpoints/workflow_id.json
2. Include full state: phase metadata, artifact paths, decisions, errors
3. PRUNE state from context
4. On resume: Load checkpoint, extract only needed metadata

Benefit: Unlimited state storage, minimal context consumption
```

**Checkpoint Content Example**:
```json
{
  "plan_path": "specs/027_auth/plans/027_implementation.md",
  "current_phase": 3,
  "completed_phases": [1, 2],
  "phase_3_progress": {
    "completed_tasks": [1],
    "pending_tasks": [2, 3],
    "files_modified": ["components/LoginForm.vue"]
  },
  "context_summary": {
    "phase_1": "Database schema created, migrations run",
    "phase_2": "API endpoints implemented, tests passing"
  }
}
```

**Quantified Impact**:
- Full workflow state without checkpoints: 10,000+ tokens in context
- Checkpoint storage: Full state in external file (0 context tokens)
- On-demand loading: 500 tokens (metadata only)
- Context reduction: 95% (10,000 tokens → 500 tokens)

**Implementation Reference**:
- Utility: `.claude/lib/checkpoint-utils.sh`
- Pattern documentation: `.claude/docs/concepts/patterns/checkpoint-recovery.md`
- Real-world usage: `/implement` command phase resumption

## Real-World Performance Metrics

### Orchestrate Command (7-Phase Workflow)

**Without Context Protection**:
- Phase 1 (Research): 4 agents × 5,000 tokens = 20,000 tokens (80%)
- Cannot proceed to planning (context overflow)
- Must reduce to 2 research agents
- Sequential execution required (no parallelization)

**With Context Protection**:
- Phase 1 (Research): 4 agents × 250 tokens = 1,000 tokens (4%)
- Phase 2 (Planning): 1 agent × 300 tokens = 300 tokens (1%)
- Phase 3 (Implementation): Waves × 200 tokens = 800 tokens (3%)
- Phases 4-7: 2,000 tokens (8%)
- Total: 4,100 tokens (16% context usage)
- Parallel execution: 4 research agents + wave-based implementation
- Time savings: 40-60% vs sequential execution

### Hierarchical Supervision (10+ Agents)

**Without Sub-Supervisors**:
- 10 agents × 500 tokens = 5,000 tokens (25% context)
- Approaching context limits, cannot scale further

**With Sub-Supervisors**:
- 3 sub-supervisors × 150 tokens = 450 tokens (2.25% context)
- Context reduction: 91%
- Scalability improvement: Enables 40+ agents before hitting 30% threshold (vs 12 agents without)

### Implementation Command with Subagent Delegation

**Trigger**: Phase complexity ≥8 OR tasks >10

**Without Delegation**:
- Primary agent explores codebase directly
- Context accumulation: 8,000+ tokens before implementation
- Risk of context overflow mid-phase

**With Delegation**:
- Invoke `implementation-researcher` subagent
- Subagent creates exploration artifact (5,000 tokens saved to file)
- Subagent returns metadata (250 tokens)
- Primary agent reads artifact on-demand during implementation
- Context saved: 95% (5,000 tokens → 250 tokens)
- Context pruned after phase completion

## Best Practices for Context Window Protection

### For Command Developers

1. **Always extract metadata before storing agent responses**
   - Use `extract_report_metadata()` or `extract_plan_metadata()`
   - Store metadata in variables (250 tokens), not full content (5,000 tokens)
   - Target: <300 tokens per artifact reference

2. **Apply forward message pattern for all agent handoffs**
   - DO NOT paraphrase or re-summarize subagent metadata
   - Forward metadata structures directly with minimal transition text
   - Target: <50 tokens overhead per agent forwarded

3. **Implement aggressive pruning after phase completion**
   - Call `prune_phase_metadata()` when phase completes
   - Clear Layer 4 (transient) data immediately after use
   - Retain only Layer 3 (metadata) for subsequent phases

4. **Use layered context architecture**
   - Permanent data (Layer 1): User request, workflow type
   - Phase-scoped data (Layer 2): Current phase instructions only
   - Metadata (Layer 3): Artifact paths + summaries
   - Transient (Layer 4): Full agent responses (prune immediately)

5. **Checkpoint workflow state for long-running operations**
   - Save state after each phase completion
   - Store full state externally (checkpoint file)
   - Load only needed metadata on resume
   - Target: <500 tokens for state restoration

### For Agent Developers

1. **Return metadata-only in agent completion protocol**
   - Title + 50-word summary + key_findings + recommendations + file_paths
   - DO NOT include full artifact content in response
   - Target: 200-300 tokens per agent response

2. **Create full artifacts in files, not in response text**
   - Write comprehensive reports/plans to files
   - Return only path + metadata in response
   - Supervisor reads file on-demand if needed

3. **Structure metadata for easy forwarding**
   - Use consistent JSON schema
   - Keep summaries to 50 words maximum
   - Limit key_findings to 3-5 items (one sentence each)

### For Workflow Orchestrators

1. **Monitor context usage throughout workflow**
   - Target: <30% context usage across all phases
   - Alert if any phase exceeds 40% usage
   - Trigger additional pruning if approaching 50%

2. **Use parallel execution where possible**
   - Independent research topics: Parallel agents
   - Independent implementation phases: Wave-based execution
   - Time savings: 40-60% vs sequential
   - Context savings: Metadata collected simultaneously

3. **Maintain master plan as primary context anchor**
   - Store master plan metadata (not full content)
   - Update checkboxes via plan hierarchy updates
   - Reference artifact paths for detailed information
   - Target: <1,000 tokens for master plan context

4. **Read full artifacts only when absolutely necessary**
   - Use metadata for decision-making (95% of cases)
   - Read full content only for synthesis/integration (5% of cases)
   - Prune full content immediately after reading

## Context Reduction Validation

### Target Metrics

**Per-Artifact**:
- Full content: 1,000-5,000 tokens
- Metadata: 50-250 tokens
- Reduction: 80-95%

**Per-Phase**:
- Without hierarchy: 5,000-15,000 tokens
- With hierarchy: 500-2,000 tokens
- Reduction: 87-97%

**Full Workflow**:
- Without hierarchy: 20,000-50,000 tokens (80-200% context usage)
- With hierarchy: 2,000-8,000 tokens (8-32% context usage)
- Reduction: 84-96%
- Target: <30% context usage throughout workflows

### Validation Script Pattern

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Context reduction validation

CONTEXT_BEFORE=$(get_context_size)

# Invoke subagent
Task { ... }

# Extract metadata and prune
metadata=$(extract_report_metadata "$report_path")
prune_subagent_output "$subagent_id"

CONTEXT_AFTER=$(get_context_size)

# Calculate reduction
REDUCTION=$((100 - (CONTEXT_AFTER * 100 / CONTEXT_BEFORE)))
echo "Context reduction: ${REDUCTION}%"

# Expected: ≥90% reduction per subagent
```

### Performance Dashboard

**Tracked Metrics** (`.claude/data/logs/context-metrics.log`):
- Context before subagent invocation
- Context after subagent completion
- Reduction percentage
- Subagent execution time
- Artifact count
- Metadata size

**Query Example**:
```bash
# Calculate average reduction
grep "REDUCTION:" .claude/data/logs/context-metrics.log | \
  awk '{sum+=$NF} END {print "Avg:", sum/NR"%"}'

# Expected: >85% average reduction
```

## Common Anti-Patterns and Failures

### Anti-Pattern 1: Loading Full Content When Metadata Sufficient

```markdown
❌ BAD:
full_report=$(cat specs/027_auth/reports/001_patterns.md)
if [[ "$full_report" =~ "JWT" ]]; then
  # Decision based on keyword search
fi

Result: 5,000 tokens loaded for simple keyword check

✓ GOOD:
metadata=$(extract_report_metadata "specs/027_auth/reports/001_patterns.md")
summary=$(echo "$metadata" | jq -r '.summary')
if [[ "$summary" =~ "JWT" ]]; then
  # Decision based on metadata summary
fi

Result: 250 tokens loaded for same decision
Context saved: 4,750 tokens (95% reduction)
```

### Anti-Pattern 2: No Pruning Between Phases

```markdown
❌ BAD:
Phase 1 complete. Research results: [5,000 tokens]
Phase 2 complete. Plan created: [3,000 tokens]
Phase 3 complete. Implementation: [8,000 tokens]

Total: 16,000 tokens (64% context) - cannot proceed to Phase 4

✓ GOOD:
Phase 1 complete. Research metadata: [250 tokens]
prune_phase_metadata "research"
Phase 2 complete. Plan metadata: [300 tokens]
prune_phase_metadata "planning"
Phase 3 complete. Implementation metadata: [200 tokens]
prune_phase_metadata "implementation"

Total: 750 tokens (3% context) - ready for Phase 4
```

### Anti-Pattern 3: Re-Summarization Overhead

```markdown
❌ BAD:
Agent returns: {summary: "50 words"}
Supervisor rewrites: "Based on the findings, [100 words paraphrasing]"

Overhead: 50 words original + 100 words paraphrase = 150 words (200% bloat)

✓ GOOD:
Agent returns: {summary: "50 words"}
Supervisor forwards: {summary: "50 words"}

Overhead: 50 words original + 0 words forwarding = 50 words (0% bloat)
```

## Recommendations

### Priority 1: Implement Metadata-Only Passing

**Action**: Ensure all subagent invocations extract and pass only metadata (title + 50-word summary + key_findings + recommendations + file_paths).

**Impact**: 95% context reduction per subagent (5,000 tokens → 250 tokens)

**Implementation**:
- Use `extract_report_metadata()` from `.claude/lib/metadata-extraction.sh`
- Structure agent completion protocol to return metadata JSON only
- Store metadata in variables, not full content

### Priority 2: Apply Forward Message Pattern

**Action**: Remove all re-summarization and paraphrasing from supervisor handoffs between agents and phases.

**Impact**: 95% reduction in forwarding overhead (800 tokens → 40 tokens for 4 agents)

## Conclusion

Context window protection is achieved through systematic application of five core strategies: metadata-only passing (99% reduction), forward message pattern (eliminates paraphrasing overhead), aggressive context pruning (80-90% reduction per phase), layered context architecture (86% total reduction), and checkpoint-based external storage (95% state restoration reduction). Real-world implementations demonstrate that these strategies enable complex multi-phase workflows to maintain <30% context usage throughout execution, allowing 10+ parallel agents versus 2-3 without protection. The key insight is that most workflow decisions can be made using metadata alone (95% of cases), with full artifact content needed only for synthesis/integration (5% of cases). Commands that fail to implement these strategies consistently exceed 80% context usage within 2-3 phases and cannot proceed to completion.
