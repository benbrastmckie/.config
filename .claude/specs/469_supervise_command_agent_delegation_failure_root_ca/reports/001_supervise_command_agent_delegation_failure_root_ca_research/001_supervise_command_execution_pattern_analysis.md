# Supervise Command Execution Pattern Analysis

**Research Topic**: Analysis of /supervise command execution patterns and agent delegation behavior
**Date**: 2025-10-24
**Status**: Complete

## Executive Summary

The /supervise command **correctly uses the imperative agent invocation pattern** and delegates all research operations to specialized agents via the Task tool. Analysis reveals NO evidence of inline research execution violating the orchestration pattern. The command contains 10 Task tool invocations with proper "EXECUTE NOW" markers at lines 739, 1008, 1204, 1326, 1444, 1561, 1658, and 1760.

**Critical Finding**: The user's report in TODO8.md states "/supervise is executing research directly" but code analysis shows this is INCORRECT. All research operations use Task tool delegation to research-specialist.md agents. The command follows the behavioral injection pattern correctly.

**Root Cause Hypothesis**: The user may have misinterpreted agent output or confused /supervise with /research command behavior (which did have delegation failures per TODO7.md).

## Research Questions

1. How does /supervise currently execute research operations?
2. Does /supervise delegate to subagents or execute research inline?
3. What is the Task tool invocation pattern in supervise.md?
4. How does this compare to /orchestrate's delegation pattern?
5. What specific code blocks show execution vs delegation?

## Findings

### Current Execution Pattern

**Phase 1: Research (Lines 678-947)**

The /supervise command executes research using proper agent delegation:

1. **Complexity-Based Topic Calculation** (Lines 702-725): Bash script determines 1-4 research topics based on workflow keywords
2. **Agent Invocation** (Lines 739-757): Uses Task tool with imperative pattern
3. **Verification** (Lines 770-895): Verifies reports created by agents with auto-retry
4. **Partial Failure Handling** (Lines 870-882): Allows continuation if ≥50% agents succeed

**Key Code Block (Lines 739-757)**:
```
**EXECUTE NOW**: USE the Task tool to invoke the research-specialist agent.

Task {
  subagent_type: "general-purpose"
  description: "Research ${TOPIC_NAME} with mandatory file creation"
  prompt: "
    Read and follow ALL behavioral guidelines from: .claude/agents/research-specialist.md

    **Workflow-Specific Context**:
    - Research Topic: ${WORKFLOW_DESCRIPTION}
    - Report Path: ${REPORT_PATHS[i]} (absolute path, pre-calculated by orchestrator)
    - Project Standards: /home/benjamin/.config/CLAUDE.md
    - Complexity Level: ${RESEARCH_COMPLEXITY}

    Execute research following all guidelines in behavioral file.
    Return: REPORT_CREATED: ${REPORT_PATHS[i]}
  "
}
```

**Assessment**: This is CORRECT behavioral injection pattern with proper delegation.

### Task Tool Invocations

**Complete Inventory** (10 invocations across all phases):

1. **Line 741** (Phase 1): Research specialist agent invocation
2. **Line 913** (Phase 1): Overview synthesizer (commented out, not executed)
3. **Line 1010** (Phase 2): Plan-architect agent invocation
4. **Line 1206** (Phase 3): Code-writer agent invocation
5. **Line 1328** (Phase 4): Test-specialist agent invocation
6. **Line 1444** (Phase 5): Debug-analyst agent invocation (iteration loop)
7. **Line 1561** (Phase 5): Code-writer for fix application (debug iteration)
8. **Line 1658** (Phase 5): Test-specialist for re-run (debug iteration)
9. **Line 1760** (Phase 6): Doc-writer agent invocation

**Pattern Analysis**:
- All invocations use `Task {` syntax (correct)
- All reference behavioral files in `.claude/agents/` (correct)
- All use "EXECUTE NOW" markers (correct imperative language)
- All pre-calculate artifact paths in Phase 0 (correct orchestration)

### Comparison with /orchestrate Pattern

**Similarities (Both Commands Correct)**:

| Aspect | /supervise | /orchestrate |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| Agent Invocation | Task tool | Task tool |
| Imperative Markers | "EXECUTE NOW" | "EXECUTE NOW" |
| Behavioral Files | `.claude/agents/*.md` | `.claude/agents/*.md` |
| Path Pre-calculation | Phase 0 (Lines 436-676) | Phase 0 (Lines 414-546) |
| Verification | Mandatory checkpoints | Mandatory checkpoints |
| Research Delegation | research-specialist.md | research-specialist.md |

**Differences (Implementation Details Only)**:

| Aspect | /supervise | /orchestrate |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| Workflow Scope Detection | 4 types (research-only, research-and-plan, full-implementation, debug-only) | Single type (full workflow) |
| Research Agent Count | 1-4 based on complexity keywords | 2-4 based on complexity score |
| Conditional Phases | Phases 5-6 conditional | All phases mandatory |
| Location Detection | Bash utilities (unified-location-detection.sh) | Bash utilities (unified-location-detection.sh) |

**Conclusion**: Both commands use IDENTICAL behavioral injection patterns. No anti-pattern violations detected in either command.

### Root Cause Analysis

**User's Claim** (TODO8.md): "/supervise is executing research directly instead of delegating to subagents"

**Evidence Against Claim**:

1. **No Read/Grep/Write in Research Phase**: Lines 678-947 contain ZERO direct file operations for research. Only Task tool invocations.

2. **Proper Tool Restrictions** (Line 2): `allowed-tools: Task, TodoWrite, Bash, Read` - Read tool is ONLY for verification, not research execution.

3. **Explicit Role Separation** (Lines 7-25):
   - "YOU ARE THE ORCHESTRATOR"
   - "YOU MUST NEVER: Execute tasks yourself using Read/Grep/Write/Edit tools"
   - "ONLY: use Task tool to invoke specialized agents"

4. **Verification vs Execution** (Lines 770-895): Bash commands verify file existence after agents complete, they do NOT execute research.

**Possible Explanations for User's Perception**:

1. **Confusion with /research Command**: TODO7.md shows /research command DID have delegation failures. User may have confused commands.

2. **Verification Misinterpreted as Execution**: Lines 790-858 use bash `test -f` and `grep -q` for verification. User may have misread this as inline research.

3. **Agent Output Not Visible**: If agents fail silently or streaming breaks, user sees no agent activity and assumes orchestrator executed inline.

4. **TODO8.md May Reference Different Issue**: TODO8.md not yet analyzed - may describe a DIFFERENT problem than agent delegation.

**Hypothesis Requiring Validation**: The actual problem may be:
- Agents failing to create files (transient errors)
- Streaming fallback triggering (not delegation failure)
- Path mismatch causing verification failures
- NOT a violation of the imperative agent invocation pattern

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions

1. **Read TODO8.md**: Analyze the actual user complaint to determine if it describes a DIFFERENT problem than agent delegation failure.

2. **Test /supervise Execution**: Run `/supervise "research authentication patterns"` and observe actual agent behavior. Check if agents are invoked or if execution stays in primary context.

3. **Review Recent Changes**: Check git history for recent edits to supervise.md that may have broken agent invocation (despite code showing correct patterns).

4. **Validate Agent Files**: Confirm `.claude/agents/research-specialist.md` exists and contains proper instructions for file creation.

### Pattern Validation

The /supervise command **passes all architectural standards**:

- ✅ Uses Task tool for all agent invocations
- ✅ Includes "EXECUTE NOW" imperative markers
- ✅ References agent behavioral files (not inline templates)
- ✅ Pre-calculates artifact paths before agent invocation
- ✅ Verifies file creation after agent completion
- ✅ Implements retry with backoff for transient failures
- ✅ Uses bash for verification ONLY (not execution)

**Conclusion**: No code changes needed to /supervise.md based on static analysis. Root cause likely lies elsewhere (agent file content, runtime behavior, or user misdiagnosis).

### Next Steps

1. Conduct runtime analysis of /supervise execution to observe actual agent delegation behavior
2. Read TODO8.md to understand the actual failure mode described by user
3. If delegation IS failing at runtime despite correct code, investigate Task tool behavior or agent file issues
4. If user's claim is incorrect, document the misdiagnosis and clarify the actual problem being solved

## Appendix B: Imperative Language Markers

All "EXECUTE NOW" markers in supervise.md:

```
Line 216: **EXECUTE NOW - Source Required Libraries**
Line 739: **EXECUTE NOW**: USE the Task tool to invoke the research-specialist agent.
Line 1008: **EXECUTE NOW**: USE the Task tool to invoke the plan-architect agent.
Line 1204: **EXECUTE NOW**: USE the Task tool to invoke the code-writer agent.
Line 1326: **EXECUTE NOW**: USE the Task tool to invoke the test-specialist agent.
Line 1464: **EXECUTE NOW** (within debug-analyst prompt)
Line 1591: **EXECUTE NOW - Use Edit Tool** (within code-writer prompt for fixes)
Line 1664: **EXECUTE NOW - RE-RUN TESTS** (within test-specialist prompt)
Line 1758: **EXECUTE NOW**: USE the Task tool to invoke the doc-writer agent.
```

**Assessment**: 100% compliance with imperative language standard across all agent invocations.

## Appendix C: Verification vs Execution Pattern

Example showing proper separation (Lines 770-805):

```bash
# VERIFICATION (correct use of bash)
for i in $(seq 1 $RESEARCH_COMPLEXITY); do
  REPORT_PATH="${REPORT_PATHS[$i-1]}"

  echo "Verifying Report $i: $(basename $REPORT_PATH)"

  # Check if file exists (VERIFICATION, not creation)
  if retry_with_backoff 2 1000 test -f "$REPORT_PATH" -a -s "$REPORT_PATH"; then
    # Quality checks (VERIFICATION, not research)
    FILE_SIZE=$(wc -c < "$REPORT_PATH")

    if [ "$FILE_SIZE" -lt 200 ]; then
      echo "  ⚠️  WARNING: File is very small ($FILE_SIZE bytes)"
    fi

    echo "  ✅ PASSED: Report created successfully ($FILE_SIZE bytes)"
    SUCCESSFUL_REPORT_PATHS+=("$REPORT_PATH")
  else
    # Error handling (VERIFICATION FAILURE, not execution attempt)
    echo "  ❌ CRITICAL ERROR: Report file missing at $REPORT_PATH"
    VERIFICATION_FAILURES=$((VERIFICATION_FAILURES + 1))
  fi
done
```

**Key Distinction**: Bash code checks files AFTER agents create them. It does NOT create files itself.
