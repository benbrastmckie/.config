## Phase Structure

The command currently implements a 6-phase workflow (Phases 0-5, with Phase 6 documented but implementation merged into Phase 3):

### Phase 0: Project Location Determination (Foundation)
- **Lines**: 390-593 (~203 lines)
- **Purpose**: Establish artifact organization by invoking location-specialist agent
- **Key Components**:
  - Invokes location-specialist agent via Task tool
  - Creates topic directory structure: `specs/NNN_topic/{reports,plans,summaries,debug,scripts,outputs}/`
  - Extracts and validates location context
  - Mandatory verification checkpoint with fallback mechanism (lines 512-550)
- **Agent**: location-specialist

### Phase 1: Research Phase (Parallel Execution)
- **Lines**: 596-1110 (~514 lines)
- **Purpose**: Coordinate 2-4 parallel research-specialist agents for investigation
- **Key Components**:
  - Complexity analysis and thinking mode determination (lines 626-639)
  - Report path pre-calculation (lines 641-752)
  - Auto-retry wrapper with 3 escalating templates (lines 857-1027):
    - Attempt 1: Standard template
    - Attempt 2: Ultra-explicit enforcement
    - Attempt 3: Step-by-step enforcement
  - Mandatory verification with degraded continuation (not fallback)
  - Research synthesis into overview report (lines 1111-1360)
- **Agents**: 2-4 research-specialist agents (parallel)

### Phase 2: Planning Phase (Sequential)
- **Lines**: 1361-2124 (~763 lines)
- **Purpose**: Invoke plan-architect agent to create implementation plan
- **Key Components**:
  - Auto-retry logic with 3 escalating templates (lines 1515-1783)
  - Plan validation and metadata extraction (lines 1784-2034)
  - Checkpoint creation with plan metadata
- **Agent**: plan-architect

### Phase 3: Implementation Phase (Adaptive Execution)
- **Lines**: 2125-3068 (~943 lines)
- **Purpose**: Invoke code-writer agent to execute plan with wave-based execution
- **Key Components**:
  - Behavioral injection pattern (DO NOT use SlashCommand)
  - Wave-based parallelization for independent phases
  - Integrated testing per phase
  - Git commit workflow
  - Embedded debugging loop (conditional, max 3 iterations)
- **Agent**: code-writer

### Phase 4: Comprehensive Testing
- **Lines**: 3070-3308 (~238 lines)
- **Purpose**: Execute comprehensive test suite via test-specialist agent
- **Key Components**:
  - Invokes test-specialist with behavioral injection
  - Mandatory verification of test output file (lines 3156-3195)
  - Parses structured test results
  - Conditional branching: tests pass → skip Phase 5, tests fail → enter Phase 5
- **Agent**: test-specialist

### Phase 5: Debugging Loop (Conditional)
- **Lines**: 2623-3068 (embedded in Phase 3), 3309-3068 (conditional logic)
- **Purpose**: Iterative debugging if tests fail (max 3 iterations)
- **Key Components**:
  - Debug-specialist invocation for root cause analysis
  - Code-writer invocation to apply fixes
  - Re-test after each iteration
  - Escalation to user after 3 failed attempts
  - No fallback file creation - only subagents create artifacts
- **Agents**: debug-specialist + code-writer (alternating)

### Phase 6: Documentation Phase
- **Lines**: 3309-4195 (~886 lines)
- **Purpose**: Invoke doc-writer agent for documentation and workflow summary
- **Key Components**:
  - Documentation updates based on implementation
  - Workflow summary generation with cross-references
  - Plan hierarchy updates (if expanded plans used)
  - GitHub PR creation (conditional, via github-specialist)
  - Summary file verification with fallback (lines 3888-3926)
- **Agents**: doc-writer, spec-updater (conditional), github-specialist (conditional)

## Fallback Mechanisms Identified

The command contains **multiple fallback mechanisms** that create files when agents fail:

### 1. Location Phase Fallback (Lines 512-529)
```bash
if [ ! -d "$TOPIC_PATH" ]; then
  echo "FALLBACK: location-specialist failed - creating directory structure manually"
  mkdir -p "$TOPIC_PATH"/{reports,plans,summaries,debug,scripts,outputs}
fi
```
**Type**: Directory creation fallback

### 2. Research Overview Fallback (Lines 1199-1227)
```bash
echo "FALLBACK: Creating minimal overview template"
cat > "$OVERVIEW_PATH" <<EOF
[Minimal overview content]
EOF
```
**Type**: File creation fallback for research synthesis

### 3. Test Output Fallback (Lines 3164-3182)
```bash
echo "FALLBACK: Creating minimal test report"
cat > "$TEST_OUTPUT" <<'EOF'
# Test Results
Minimal test report created by fallback mechanism.
EOF
```
**Type**: File creation fallback for test results

### 4. Debug Report Fallback (Lines 2777-2800)
```bash
echo "FALLBACK: Creating minimal debug report template"
# Creates minimal debug report if debug-specialist fails
```
**Type**: File creation fallback for debugging

### 5. Summary File Fallback (Lines 3888-3926)
```bash
echo "Creating minimal summary template as fallback..."
# Creates summary when doc-writer agent fails
```
**Type**: File creation fallback for workflow summary

### Auto-Retry vs Fallback Architecture

**Current Implementation**:
- **Research Phase**: Uses auto-retry (3 attempts with escalating enforcement) + degraded continuation (NOT fallback)
- **Planning Phase**: Uses auto-retry (3 attempts with escalating enforcement)
- **Implementation Phase**: Uses behavioral injection with code-writer agent (no retry/fallback documented in Phase 3 section)
- **Testing Phase**: Has fallback file creation
- **Debugging Phase**: No explicit fallback (max 3 iterations, then escalate)
- **Documentation Phase**: Has fallback file creation

**Documented Position on Fallbacks** (Lines 1079-1104):
> **Auto-Recovery Architecture - No Fallback Mechanisms**
>
> **ENFORCEMENT**: /orchestrate uses auto-retry with escalating templates. NO orchestrator-created fallback files.
>
> 1. Auto-Retry: Research phase automatically retries each topic up to 3 times with escalating enforcement
> 2. File Validation: Built into retry loop - checks file exists and has content after each attempt
> 5. NO Orchestrator Fallback: Orchestrator NEVER creates files - only subagents create artifacts
>
> REMOVED (prior anti-pattern):
> - Orchestrator fallback file creation (cat > "$PATH" <<EOF)
> - Post-hoc verification with fallback triggers

**CONTRADICTION**: The command documentation claims "NO orchestrator fallback" but the code contains 5+ fallback mechanisms where orchestrator creates files.

## Workflow Scope Detection

**FINDING**: Limited/minimal workflow scope detection logic.

### What Exists:
1. **Workflow Type Determination** (Lines 108, 178, 362):
   - Sets `workflow_type: "feature|refactor|debug|investigation"`
   - Determined from workflow description analysis
   - No explicit detection algorithm provided

2. **Complexity Analysis** (Lines 626-639):
   - Calculates complexity score based on keywords
   - Formula: keywords × weights + estimated_files / 5 + (research_topics - 1) × 2
   - Maps score to thinking mode: 0-3 (standard), 4-6 (think), 7-9 (think hard), 10+ (think harder)

3. **Research Topic Count Selection** (Lines 652-657):
   - Low complexity (0-3): 0-1 topics (skip research)
   - Medium complexity (4-6): 2 topics
   - High complexity (7-9): 3 topics
   - Critical complexity (10+): 4 topics

### What's Missing:
- **No explicit workflow scope detection**: No logic to determine if workflow is "simple", "moderate", or "complex"
- **No phase skipping logic**: All phases (0-5) executed regardless of workflow complexity (except Research can be skipped for low complexity)
- **No adaptive phase selection**: Command always attempts all phases in sequence
- **Hardcoded phase structure**: No dynamic adjustment based on workflow characteristics

**IMPLICATION**: The 070 refactor plan identified this as a deficiency - the command lacks intelligent scope detection to skip unnecessary phases.

## References to Removed Features

### Phase 2.5 and Phase 4 References
**Search Results**: No references to "Phase 2.5" found (✓ successfully removed in 070 refactor)
**Search Results**: References to "Phase 4" exist but refer to current Testing phase (not expansion phase) (✓ renumbering successful)

### Complexity Evaluation References
The command contains **extensive** complexity evaluation logic:
- Line 111: "Duration estimation: Estimate time based on workflow complexity"
- Line 179: "thinking_mode: null  # Will be set based on complexity score"
- Line 335: "Complexity Indicators: Keywords suggesting scope and approach"
- Lines 602-607: Research phase complexity analysis
- Lines 626-656: Detailed complexity score calculation algorithm
- Lines 1613, 1652, 1702: Plan complexity indicators in agent templates
- Lines 1991-1996: Plan complexity extraction from plan-architect output
- Lines 2070-2075: Plan complexity in checkpoint state

**FINDING**: Complexity evaluation logic remains extensively integrated throughout the command, but the automatic expansion trigger (Phase 2.5 → Phase 4) has been removed.

## Deficiencies Confirmed

Cross-referencing with 070 refactor plan objectives:

### Successfully Completed (070 Refactor):
- ✅ Phase 2.5 (Complexity Evaluation) removed as standalone phase
- ✅ Phase 4 (Automatic Expansion) removed as standalone phase
- ✅ Phase numbering simplified to 0-5 (sequential)
- ✅ File size reduced from 206KB (6,051 lines) to 188KB (5,478 lines) - **13.8% reduction**
- ✅ Complexity evaluation remains inline (for thinking mode and research topics)

### Partially Addressed:
- ⚠️ User control enhancement: AskUserQuestion for expansion marked as DEFERRED (line 73)
- ⚠️ Expansion logic transfer: Marked as FUTURE ENHANCEMENT (line 74)

### Remaining Issues:
- ❌ **Fallback mechanisms contradiction**: Documentation claims "NO fallback" but 5+ fallback mechanisms exist
- ❌ **Workflow scope detection**: No intelligent logic to skip unnecessary phases based on workflow characteristics
- ❌ **File size target**: Current 5,478 lines vs target 3,600-4,200 lines (achieved 13.8% vs target 30-40%)

## Standards Compliance Issues

### Behavioral Injection Pattern Compliance
**Status**: ✅ COMPLIANT

Evidence:
- Lines 10-36: Explicit warning against SlashCommand tool usage
- Lines 1837, 2189, 2204: Critical instructions to use Task tool, not SlashCommand
- Line 2204: "CRITICAL: DO NOT use SlashCommand tool. Use Task tool with explicit Behavioral Injection Pattern."
- All agent invocations use Task tool with injected context

### Execution Enforcement Standards
**Status**: ✅ COMPLIANT (after 070 Revision 2)

Evidence from 070 plan (lines 27-38):
- ✅ Standard 0: Execution Enforcement (EXECUTE NOW, MANDATORY VERIFICATION)
- ✅ Standard 1: Inline Execution Content (37+ bash blocks in plan, 51 in orchestrate.md)
- ✅ Directory Protocols (topic-based organization via location-specialist)
- ✅ Imperative Language Guidelines (YOU MUST, CRITICAL, REQUIRED throughout)

**Metrics** (from 070 Revision 2):
- Bash blocks: 51 (current file)
- Verification checkpoints: 26+ documented
- Fallback mechanisms: 3 documented in plan, 5+ identified in code
- EXECUTE NOW markers: Present throughout (≥12 per validation checkpoint)

### Verification and Fallback Pattern Compliance
**Status**: ⚠️ PARTIAL COMPLIANCE / CONTRADICTION

Evidence:
- ✅ Mandatory verification checkpoints present after each agent invocation
- ✅ File existence checks before proceeding to next phase
- ❌ **CONTRADICTION**: Documentation claims "NO orchestrator fallback" (lines 1079-1104) but code contains 5+ fallback mechanisms
- ❌ Fallback file creation violates documented "Auto-Recovery Architecture"

### Context Management Pattern Compliance
**Status**: ✅ COMPLIANT

Evidence:
- Lines 3147-3150: "Full test output (10,000+ tokens) MUST be saved to test_output_file. Return ONLY structured summary (<100 tokens)"
- Metadata-based context passing throughout (forward message pattern)
- Orchestrator maintains <30% context usage target

## Summary: Current State Assessment

**File Characteristics**:
- Size: 5,478 lines, 188KB, ~28,900 tokens
- Structure: Clean 6-phase workflow (0→1→2→3→4→5)
- Agent invocations: 18 Task tool calls
- Bash execution blocks: 51

**Architectural Status**:
- ✅ Behavioral injection pattern enforced (no SlashCommand usage)
- ✅ Execution enforcement with EXECUTE NOW and verification checkpoints
- ✅ Topic-based artifact organization via location-specialist
- ⚠️ Fallback mechanisms present despite documentation claiming removal
- ❌ Workflow scope detection logic minimal/absent
- ❌ File size reduction target not met (13.8% vs 30-40% target)

**Key Simplification Opportunities**:
1. **Resolve fallback contradiction**: Either remove fallback mechanisms or update documentation
2. **Add workflow scope detection**: Implement logic to skip phases for simple workflows
3. **Reduce file size further**: Extract additional content to reference files (currently ~40% above target)
4. **Complete user control enhancement**: Implement deferred AskUserQuestion for expansion option
