- After file creation operations (backup files, report files, plan files)
- After directory creation operations (topic directories, subdirectories)
- After rollback operations (file restoration)

**Current Checkpoints in Plan**:

1. **Phase 0 (Prerequisites)**: ✓ VERIFICATION checkpoint present (lines 139-144)
   - Verifies library file existence, executability, test files
   - Assessment: COMPLIANT

2. **Phase 1 (/report and /research)**: ❌ Missing MANDATORY VERIFICATION checkpoint
   - Line 172: "**Validation**: Test refactored command..." lacks explicit MANDATORY VERIFICATION marker

- Line 549: Reference to phase_5_system_wide_integration_testing.md
- Line 559: Correct Level 1 file reference format

**Assessment**: 100% compliant. Follows Level 1 progressive organization standards.

### Success Criteria Assessment

**Writing Standards Compliance** (Lines 48-58: present-focused, no temporal markers):

**Success Criteria Block** (Lines 37-51):
- Line 39: "/report command refactored..." ✓ Present-focused
- Line 40: "/research command refactored..." ✓ Present-focused
- Line 41: "Unified library extended..." ✓ Present-focused
- Line 42: "/plan command refactored..." ✓ Present-focused
- Line 43: "/orchestrate command refactored..." ✓ Present-focused
- Line 44: "Model metadata standardized..." ✓ Present-focused

**Assessment**: 100% compliant with Writing Standards (no temporal markers, present-focused language).

**Imperative Language in Success Criteria**:
- Current: Most criteria use passive voice ("command refactored", "library extended")
- Standard expectation: Formal requirements should use SHALL (Imperative Language Guide:64-75)
- Example fix: "/report command SHALL be refactored to use unified library"
- Priority: Low (success criteria formatting preference, not execution requirement)

### Rollback Procedure Completeness

**Rollback Procedure Locations**:
1. Phase 1 (line 293-306): Per-command rollback for /report and /research
2. Phase 2 (line 375-381): Per-command rollback for /plan
3. Phase 3 (line 459-465): Per-command rollback for /orchestrate
4. Rollback Plan section (lines 849-898): System-wide rollback procedures

**Verification and Fallback Pattern Compliance** (Lines 83-106):

**Phase 1 Rollback Procedure** (Lines 293-306):
- ✓ Backup restoration commands present
- ✓ Conditional logic (if Gate 1 fails)
- ❌ Missing MANDATORY VERIFICATION after file restoration
- ❌ Missing escalation language (uses "Investigate failures" instead of "MUST escalate to user")
- Priority: Medium

**System-Wide Rollback** (Lines 861-883):
- ✓ Per-command restoration
- ✓ Verification step included (line 881)
- ✓ Post-rollback actions defined (lines 894-898)
- Assessment: COMPLIANT

**Recommended Fix for Phase 1 Rollback**:
```markdown
If Gate 1 fails:
```bash
# YOU MUST execute rollback immediately
cp .claude/commands/report.md.backup-unified-integration .claude/commands/report.md
cp .claude/commands/research.md.backup-unified-integration .claude/commands/research.md

# MANDATORY VERIFICATION - Confirm file restoration
if ! diff -q .claude/commands/report.md .claude/commands/report.md.backup-unified-integration; then
  echo "❌ CRITICAL: Rollback failed - file not restored correctly"
  exit 1
fi
echo "✓ VERIFIED: Files restored successfully"
```

# YOU MUST investigate failures before retrying integration
```

## Recommended Revisions

This section provides specific, actionable revisions to address all compliance issues, prioritized by impact.

### Priority 1: Imperative Language Corrections (15 minutes)

**Issue 1-3, 5, 7-8, 10** (8 violations):

Apply these exact text replacements using Edit tool:

1. **Line 164**:
   - Replace: "**Analysis**: Read current /report command"
   - With: "**Analysis**: YOU MUST read current /report command"

2. **Line 172**:
   - Replace: "**Validation**: Test refactored command"
   - With: "**Validation**: YOU WILL test refactored command"

3. **Line 227**:
   - Replace: "Function creates numbered subdirectory"
   - With: "Function MUST create numbered subdirectory"

4. **Line 299** (add before code block):
   - Insert: "YOU MUST execute this rollback command immediately:"

5. **Line 338**:
   - Replace: "**Validation**: Test refactored command"
   - With: "**Validation**: YOU WILL test refactored command"

6. **Line 490**:
   - Replace: "**Review Report 074**: Extract model assignment"
   - With: "**Review Report 074**: YOU MUST extract model assignment"

7. **Line 602**:
   - Replace: "**Update /supervise docs**: Reference unified library"
   - With: "**Update /supervise docs**: YOU MUST reference unified library in documentation"

**Estimated Effort**: 5 minutes (7 simple text replacements)

### Priority 2: MANDATORY VERIFICATION Checkpoints (10 minutes)

**Issues 4, 6, 9** (3 missing checkpoints):

1. **Phase 1 (after line 172)** - Add new task:
```markdown
- [ ] **MANDATORY VERIFICATION**: After refactoring, YOU MUST verify:
  - [ ] Location detection creates correct topic directory
  - [ ] Reports created at correct paths with absolute references
  - [ ] No file creation failures in 5/5 test cases
  - [ ] Checkpoint MUST pass before proceeding to /research integration
```

2. **Phase 1 Rollback (after line 306)** - Add verification block:
```markdown
# MANDATORY VERIFICATION - Confirm rollback success
if ! diff -q .claude/commands/report.md .claude/commands/report.md.backup-unified-integration; then
  echo "❌ CRITICAL: Rollback failed - file not restored"
  exit 1
fi
echo "✓ VERIFIED: Rollback successful"

# YOU MUST investigate failures before retrying. DO NOT proceed without root cause analysis.
```

3. **Phase 4 (after line 541)** - Add new task:
```markdown
- [ ] **MANDATORY VERIFICATION**: YOU MUST confirm all 19 agents have model metadata:
  ```bash
  # Verify all agents have model frontmatter
  for agent in .claude/agents/*.md; do
    if ! grep -q "^model:" "$agent"; then
      echo "❌ Missing model metadata: $agent"
      exit 1
    fi
  done
  echo "✓ VERIFIED: All agents have model metadata"
  ```
```

**Estimated Effort**: 10 minutes (3 checkpoint additions with verification code)

### Priority 3: Success Criteria Formatting (Optional, 5 minutes)

**Issue 11** (low priority, formatting preference):

Transform success criteria to use SHALL for formal requirements:

- Line 39: "/report command SHALL be refactored to use unified library"
- Line 40: "/research command SHALL be refactored to use unified library"
- Line 41: "Unified library SHALL be extended with create_research_subdirectory()"
- Line 42: "/plan command SHALL be refactored to use unified library"

**Estimated Effort**: 5 minutes (optional, cosmetic improvement)

**Note**: This is a preference, not a requirement. Success criteria currently compliant with Writing Standards (present-focused, no temporal markers). Imperative language primarily applies to execution instructions, not goal statements.

### Summary of Revisions

**Total Estimated Effort**: 15-20 minutes (Priority 1-2 revisions)

**Breakdown**:
- Imperative language fixes: 5 minutes (7 text replacements)
- MANDATORY VERIFICATION checkpoints: 10 minutes (3 checkpoint additions)
- Success criteria formatting: 5 minutes (optional)

**Structural Changes Required**: None - all fixes are language transformations and checkpoint additions

**No Code Changes Required**: All revisions are documentation-level improvements to the plan file itself
