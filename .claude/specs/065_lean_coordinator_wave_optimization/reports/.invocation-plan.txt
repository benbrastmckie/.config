# Research Coordinator Invocation Plan
# Generated: 2025-12-10T02:11:20Z

Expected Invocations: 4

Topics:
[0] /lean-implement Command Optimization Analysis: Analyze the current /lean-implement command implementation, focusing on the lean-coordinator invocation, identify inefficiencies (79.9k tokens, 2m 51s for analysis), and propose refactoring to eliminate unnecessary analysis phases -> /home/benjamin/.config/.claude/specs/065_lean_coordinator_wave_optimization/reports/001-lean-implement-optimization.md
[1] /lean-plan Wave Definition and Encoding: Research the /lean-plan command to understand how waves should be indicated in implementation plans, ensuring compatibility with /lean-implement parallel wave execution, and optimizing metadata encoding for wave scheduling -> /home/benjamin/.config/.claude/specs/065_lean_coordinator_wave_optimization/reports/002-lean-plan-wave-definition.md
[2] Wave-Based Orchestration Architecture: Investigate parallel vs sequential wave execution patterns, phase dependencies, and how the lean-coordinator should implement wave scheduling without redundant analysis, defaulting to sequential when no waves are indicated -> /home/benjamin/.config/.claude/specs/065_lean_coordinator_wave_optimization/reports/003-wave-orchestration-architecture.md
[3] Inter-Command Coordination and Standards Compliance: Research how /lean-plan and /lean-implement should coordinate, design the inter-command coordination protocol, and ensure all changes respect .claude/docs/ standards to avoid breaking existing functionality -> /home/benjamin/.config/.claude/specs/065_lean_coordinator_wave_optimization/reports/004-inter-command-coordination.md

Status: PLAN_CREATED (invocations pending)
