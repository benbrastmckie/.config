## Overview

**REVISED UNDERSTANDING** (based on library sourcing investigation):

## Root Cause: Missing "EXECUTE NOW" Directive in Phase 0

The `/coordinate` command file has a **critical missing directive** that prevents Phase 0 from executing. Analysis reveals:

### What Exists in coordinate.md (Phase 0, lines 524-700+):
- Complete bash code blocks for library sourcing
- Path pre-calculation logic
- Workflow scope detection
- All necessary orchestrator setup code

### What's Missing:
- **NO "EXECUTE NOW" directive before Phase 0 bash blocks**
- Phase 1-7 all have "**EXECUTE NOW**: USE the Task tool" directives (lines 869, 1069, 1253, 1387, etc.)
- Phase 0 bash blocks are inside markdown code fences (```bash...```)  without execution directive

### What Actually Happened (coordinate_output.md analysis):
1. User invoked: `/coordinate "research, plan, and implement..."`
2. **Phase 0 bash blocks never executed** (no "EXECUTE NOW" directive)
3. Libraries never sourced (`workflow-detection.sh`, `unified-location-detection.sh`, etc.)
4. Functions like `detect_workflow_scope()`, `emit_progress()` never defined
5. Claude interpreted user's workflow description as natural language instruction
6. Claude started executing directly: "I'll help you implement... Let me start by researching..."
7. Claude used Search/Grep tools directly (tool constraint violation)
8. Interrupted at line 91

### Library Sourcing Failure Evidence:
- No `"✓ All libraries loaded successfully"` message (line 543 of coordinate.md)
- No `"Workflow: $WORKFLOW_SCOPE → Phases X"` message (line 673)
- No `emit_progress "0" "Libraries loaded and verified"` output (line 602)
- Coordinate_output.md shows **NO Phase 0 execution artifacts**

### Comparison with Phase 1-7 (Working):
Phase 1 (line 869): `**EXECUTE NOW**: USE the Task tool for each research topic...`
- This directive causes Claude to immediately invoke Task tool
- Works correctly when reached

Phase 0 (line 524): Just ````bash` code fence, no directive
- Claude treats this as documentation/template code
- **Never executes** - critical failure

### Why This Matters:
Without Phase 0 execution:
1. No library sourcing = no utility functions available
2. No workflow scope detection = Claude doesn't know which phases to execute
3. No path pre-calculation = agents don't know where to create files
4. Claude falls back to interpreting user input as natural language

The command file structure is correct, but Phase 0 needs an explicit execution directive like Phase 1-7 have.

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Phase 0 has explicit "EXECUTE NOW" directive before bash code blocks
- [ ] Phase 0 bash blocks execute (library sourcing occurs)
- [ ] Library functions (`detect_workflow_scope`, `emit_progress`, etc.) are defined
- [ ] Workflow scope detection executes and logs scope determination
- [ ] Path pre-calculation completes and exports variables
- [ ] Phase 1-7 execute in correct order based on detected scope
- [ ] Command delegates all research/planning/implementation to agents via Task tool
- [ ] Command executes full workflow without interruption
- [ ] All phases complete successfully with correct artifact creation
- [ ] Test coverage ≥80% for Phase 0 execution and library sourcing

## Technical Design

### Architecture Pattern: Orchestrator Delegation

The `/coordinate` command implements the **orchestrator pattern** where:
- **Orchestrator responsibilities** (allowed): Phase 0 setup (path pre-calculation, directory creation), workflow scope detection, agent invocation via Task tool, verification checkpoints
- **Executor responsibilities** (delegated to agents): Research (Read/Grep/Glob), planning (Write/Edit), implementation (Read/Write/Edit), testing (Bash)

### Current vs Correct Behavior

**Current (Incorrect) - Claude bypasses command structure**:
```
User: /coordinate "research, plan, and implement X"
  ↓
Claude interprets workflow description as natural language instruction
  ↓
Claude responds: "I'll help you implement... Let me start by researching..."
  ↓
Claude attempts to use Search/Grep/Read tools directly
  ↓
INTERRUPTED (tool constraint violation - Phase 0-7 never executed)
```

**Correct (Target) - Command structure executes as designed** (working in commit ba44766247c4):
```
User: /coordinate "research, plan, and implement X"
  ↓
Command prompt executed by Claude (not bypassed)
  ↓
Phase 0: Source libraries, detect workflow_scope="full-implementation", pre-calculate paths
  ↓
Phase 1: **EXECUTE NOW: USE the Task tool** → Delegate to research-specialist agents
  ↓
Phase 2: **EXECUTE NOW: USE the Task tool** → Delegate to plan-architect agent
  ↓
Phase 3: **EXECUTE NOW: USE the Task tool** → Delegate to implementer-coordinator agent
  ↓
SUCCESS (all work delegated, no tool violations, 100% architectural compliance)
```

### Key Changes Required

**Single Critical Fix**: Add "EXECUTE NOW" directive before Phase 0 bash blocks

1. **Add Phase 0 Execution Directive** (PRIMARY FIX)
   - Insert `**EXECUTE NOW**: USE the Bash tool to execute the following Phase 0 setup:` before line 524
   - This matches the pattern used successfully in Phase 1-7
   - Ensures bash code blocks are executed, not just displayed as documentation

2. **Verify Library Sourcing Execution**
   - Confirm `source_required_libraries()` function executes
   - Verify `"✓ All libraries loaded successfully"` message appears
   - Check that required functions are defined (`detect_workflow_scope`, `emit_progress`, etc.)
   - Ensure SCRIPT_DIR calculation works correctly

3. **Verify Workflow Scope Detection**
   - Confirm `detect_workflow_scope()` function executes with user's workflow description
   - Verify `"Workflow: $WORKFLOW_SCOPE → Phases X"` message appears
   - Check that PHASES_TO_EXECUTE variable is set correctly
   - Ensure workflow scope determines which phases run

4. **Verify Path Pre-Calculation**
   - Confirm `initialize_workflow_paths()` function executes
   - Verify topic directory is created
   - Check that artifact paths are exported for Phase 1-7 use
   - Ensure `emit_progress "0" "Libraries loaded and verified"` executes

5. **Add Validation and Testing**
   - Create test that verifies Phase 0 bash blocks execute
   - Test that library sourcing succeeds
   - Validate that functions are defined before Phase 1
   - Test all workflow scopes trigger correct phase execution

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Diagnostic Analysis and Root Cause Identification [COMPLETED]
**Objective**: Pinpoint exact locations in /coordinate command where tool constraint violations occur
**Complexity**: Low
**Dependencies**: None

Tasks:
- [x] Search `/coordinate.md` for all instances of Search/Grep/Glob tool usage
- [x] Identify code sections that attempt direct execution instead of delegation
- [x] Map each violation to corresponding workflow phase
- [x] Document expected behavior for each violating section
- [x] Create baseline test showing current interruption behavior

Testing:
```bash
# Reproduce the original failure
cd /home/benjamin/.config
echo "research simple topic" | .claude/tests/test_coordinate_tool_constraint.sh

# Expected: Command interrupted at tool constraint violation
# Output: Error message with line number and tool name
```

Validation:
- List of all tool constraint violations with line numbers
- Clear mapping: violation → correct delegation pattern
- Test script demonstrating current failure mode

### Phase 2: Implement Correct Agent Delegation Pattern [COMPLETED]
**Objective**: Replace direct tool usage with proper agent delegation via Task tool
**Complexity**: Medium
**Dependencies**: Phase 1 complete

Tasks:
- [x] Add EXECUTE NOW directive before Phase 0 bash blocks (line 522)
- [x] Add EXECUTE NOW directive for helper functions definition
- [x] Verify all Phase 1-7 already have proper EXECUTE NOW directives with Task tool delegation
- [x] Confirm no Search/Grep/Glob invocations in command logic
- [x] Ensure Phase 0 setup uses only Bash (library sourcing) and Read (verification)
- [x] Verify checkpoints after each agent completes using Bash (ls, wc, grep only)
- [x] Confirm workflow scope detection logs detected scope properly

Files Modified:
- `/home/benjamin/.config/.claude/commands/coordinate.md:811-1010` (Phase 1 Research)
- `/home/benjamin/.config/.claude/commands/coordinate.md:1011-1182` (Phase 2 Planning)
- `/home/benjamin/.config/.claude/commands/coordinate.md:1183-1359` (Phase 3 Implementation)

Testing:
```bash
# Test each workflow scope individually
cd /home/benjamin/.config

# Test research-only scope
.claude/tests/test_coordinate_research_only.sh
# Expected: Task tool invoked for research-specialist agents, no Search/Grep usage

# Test research-and-plan scope
.claude/tests/test_coordinate_research_and_plan.sh
# Expected: Task tool invoked for research + planning agents, no tool violations

# Test full-implementation scope
.claude/tests/test_coordinate_full_implementation.sh
# Expected: All phases delegate via Task tool, command completes without interruption
```

Validation:
- No Search/Grep/Glob tool invocations in command execution
- All workflow phases invoke appropriate agents via Task tool
- Verification checkpoints use only allowed tools (Bash, Read)
- Command completes without interruption for all workflow scopes

### Phase 3: Strengthen Tool Constraint Validation
**Objective**: Add automated validation to prevent future tool constraint violations
**Complexity**: Medium
**Dependencies**: Phase 2 complete

Tasks:
- [ ] Create `.claude/lib/validate-tool-constraints.sh` script
- [ ] Implement frontmatter parser to extract `allowed-tools` list
- [ ] Implement command scanner to detect tool usage patterns
- [ ] Add validation check for Search/Grep/Glob/Write/Edit tools in orchestrator commands
- [ ] Integrate validation into pre-commit hooks
- [ ] Create test suite for validation script
- [ ] Add validation check to `/coordinate` self-test on startup (Phase 0)

Files Created:
- `/home/benjamin/.config/.claude/lib/validate-tool-constraints.sh`
- `/home/benjamin/.config/.claude/tests/test_tool_constraint_validation.sh`

Files Modified:
- `/home/benjamin/.config/.claude/commands/coordinate.md` (Phase 0: add self-validation)
- `/home/benjamin/.config/.git/hooks/pre-commit` (integrate validation)

Testing:
```bash
# Test validation script directly
cd /home/benjamin/.config
.claude/lib/validate-tool-constraints.sh .claude/commands/coordinate.md
# Expected: PASS (no violations after Phase 2 fixes)

# Test that validation catches violations
echo "Search(pattern: 'test')" >> /tmp/test_command.md
.claude/lib/validate-tool-constraints.sh /tmp/test_command.md
# Expected: FAIL with violation details

# Run validation test suite
.claude/tests/test_tool_constraint_validation.sh
# Expected: All tests pass
```

Validation:
- Validation script correctly parses allowed-tools frontmatter
- Script detects Search/Grep/Glob violations in orchestrator commands
- Pre-commit hook prevents commits with tool violations
- Test suite achieves ≥80% coverage of validation logic

# Expected: All tests pass, no failures

# Test original failing scenario
/coordinate "research, plan, and implement topic directory archiving feature"
# Expected: Command completes successfully, all artifacts created

# Verify test coverage
./run_all_tests.sh --coverage
# Expected: ≥80% coverage for modified sections
```

Validation:
- All existing tests pass (no regressions)
- Original failing workflow now completes successfully
- Documentation clearly explains orchestrator responsibilities
- Troubleshooting guide helps users diagnose tool constraint violations
- Test coverage ≥80% for all modified command sections

   - **Fallback**: Document uncovered edge cases for future improvement

## Notes

### Research Report Integration

The research reports provided critical insights that shaped this implementation plan:

1. **Architectural Clarity** (OVERVIEW.md, lines 24-37): Confirmed /coordinate's Phase 0 operations are **correct orchestrator responsibilities**, not violations. This understanding prevents over-correction and maintains the 85% token reduction achieved by Phase 0 optimization.

2. **Tool Constraint as Core Issue** (coordinate_output.md analysis): The actual problem is tool constraint violation (Search/Grep usage) during workflow execution phases, not Phase 0 setup. This focuses the fix on Phases 1-3 delegation, leaving Phase 0 unchanged.

3. **Historical Context** (Report 001, lines 74-101): Specs 438, 495, 057, 502 document similar architecture violations and their fixes. These provide proven patterns for correction: remove code-fenced examples, add imperative directives, enforce completion signals.

4. **Validation as Prevention** (Report 003, Recommendation 4): Automated validation prevents regression. The validation script implementation in Phase 3 directly applies this recommendation.

### Alignment with Project Standards

- **Clean-Break Philosophy** (CLAUDE.md, lines 143-165): No backward compatibility shims needed - direct fix to command behavior
- **Fail-Fast Error Handling** (Research reports): Validation script fails immediately on violation detection
- **Imperative Language** (Report 003, lines 218-239): Implementation tasks use MUST/WILL/SHALL for critical operations
- **Testing Protocols** (CLAUDE.md, Testing Protocols section): ≥80% coverage target, run_all_tests.sh integration

### Future Enhancements

1. **Validation Expansion**: Extend tool constraint validation to all orchestration commands (/orchestrate, /supervise, /research)
2. **Metrics Tracking**: Log tool constraint violations to unified logger for trend analysis
3. **Interactive Mode**: Add `--dry-run` flag to /coordinate showing detected scope and planned agent invocations
4. **Configuration Schema**: Support custom allowed-tools per command via .claude/config.json

### Success Indicators

- [ ] Original failing workflow completes successfully
- [ ] No tool constraint violations in any workflow scope
- [ ] All tests pass with ≥80% coverage
- [ ] Documentation clearly explains orchestrator pattern
- [ ] Validation prevents future regressions

## Revision History

### 2025-10-30 - Revision 1
**Changes**: Complete rewrite of root cause analysis and implementation approach
**Reason**: Analysis of working commit ba44766247c4 revealed the command file itself is correct and has not changed
**Key Findings**:
- The coordinate.md file in ba44766247c4 is identical to current HEAD
- No tool constraint violations exist in the command file itself
- The issue is Claude Code bypassing the command's Phase 0-7 structure
- Claude interpreted the workflow description as a natural language instruction to itself
- The command's prescribed workflow never executed

**Modified Understanding**:
- **OLD**: Command file has Search/Grep/Glob tool violations that need removal
- **NEW**: Command file is architecturally correct; issue is prompt priming to prevent bypass

**Revised Implementation Strategy**:
1. Phase 1: Verify command correctness, identify bypass mechanism
2. Phase 2: Add prompt priming to prevent Claude from bypassing workflow
3. Phase 3: Add bypass detection and fail-fast error handling
4. Phase 4: Comprehensive testing of workflow execution vs bypass scenarios

**Reports Used**:
- Commit ba44766247c4 analysis
- coordinate_output.md failure analysis
- Research report OVERVIEW.md

**Impact**: Reduces implementation complexity from "fix command architecture" to "strengthen prompt priming"

---

### 2025-10-30 - Revision 2
**Changes**: Identified precise root cause - missing "EXECUTE NOW" directive in Phase 0
**Reason**: User suspected library sourcing issue; investigation confirmed Phase 0 never executes
**Key Findings**:
- Phase 0 bash blocks (lines 524-700+) exist but lack "EXECUTE NOW" directive
- Phase 1-7 all have "**EXECUTE NOW**: USE the Task tool" directives (work correctly)
- Bash blocks without explicit execution directive are treated as documentation/templates
- coordinate_output.md shows ZERO Phase 0 execution artifacts:
  - No "✓ All libraries loaded successfully" message
  - No "Workflow: $WORKFLOW_SCOPE → Phases X" message
  - No `emit_progress "0"` output
- Without library sourcing, functions like `detect_workflow_scope()` are never defined
- Claude falls back to interpreting user input as natural language instructions

**Modified Understanding**:
- **OLD (Rev 1)**: Issue is prompt priming to prevent bypass
- **NEW (Rev 2)**: Issue is missing Phase 0 execution directive causing library sourcing failure

**Revised Implementation Strategy**:
1. Phase 1: Confirm missing "EXECUTE NOW" directive is root cause
2. Phase 2: Add "**EXECUTE NOW**: USE the Bash tool" before Phase 0 bash blocks (line 524)
3. Phase 3: Verify library sourcing and workflow scope detection execute
4. Phase 4: Comprehensive testing of Phase 0 execution and full workflow

**Evidence Used**:
- coordinate.md lines 524-700 (Phase 0 bash blocks without directive)
- coordinate.md lines 869, 1069, 1253, 1387 (Phase 1-7 with directives)
- coordinate_output.md (no Phase 0 execution artifacts)
- .claude/lib/workflow-detection.sh (library exists but never sourced)

**Impact**: Pinpoints exact fix location - single directive insertion before line 524
