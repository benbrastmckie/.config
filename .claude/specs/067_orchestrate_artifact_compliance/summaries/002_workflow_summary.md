# Workflow Summary: Research Agent Report Creation Fix

## Metadata
- **Date Completed**: 2025-10-19
- **Workflow Type**: investigation + planning
- **Original Request**: Continue research to identify what's needed for research subagents to create reports in the right place, passing references and summaries back to conserve context window
- **Total Duration**: ~20 minutes

## Workflow Execution

### Phases Completed
- [x] Research (parallel) - 3 parallel research agents (~8 min)
- [x] Planning (sequential) - Plan generation (~10 min)
- [x] Documentation (sequential) - Summary creation (~2 min)

### Artifacts Generated

**Research Findings**: Inline research (not separate files) covering:
1. Report creation mechanisms in /orchestrate
2. Context minimization patterns and utilities
3. Subagent prompt requirements for file creation

**Implementation Plan**:
- Path: `.claude/specs/067_orchestrate_artifact_compliance/plans/002_fix_research_agent_report_creation.md`
- Phases: 3
- Complexity: Medium
- Link: [Implementation Plan](../plans/002_fix_research_agent_report_creation.md)

## Key Findings

### The Surprising Discovery

**The mechanism for research agents to create reports is FULLY IMPLEMENTED** in /orchestrate:

✅ **Already Exists**:
1. **Path Pre-Calculation** (orchestrate.md:504-522): Orchestrator calculates absolute paths before invoking agents
2. **Explicit Instructions** (orchestrate.md:536-560): "CRITICAL: Create Report File" with Write tool directive
3. **Agent Definition** (research-specialist.md): Has Write tool access and file creation capabilities
4. **Verification Logic** (orchestrate.md:656-674): Checks for `REPORT_PATH` in agent output

### The Problem: Execution Compliance, Not Missing Mechanism

**Why reports weren't created**: Research agents **returned summaries instead of creating files**, despite explicit instructions.

**Root Cause**: The "CRITICAL" directive is being ignored by agents. They prefer returning text over using the Write tool.

### Context Minimization (Already Designed!)

**Comprehensive utilities already exist**:
1. **`extract_report_metadata()`** - Extracts title + 50-word summary from reports (99% reduction)
2. **`forward_message()`** - Passes subagent outputs without re-summarization
3. **`prune_subagent_output()`** - Removes full output after metadata extraction (95-98% reduction)
4. **Target Performance**: <30% context usage through metadata-only passing

**Location**: `/home/benjamin/.config/.claude/lib/metadata-extraction.sh`

## Implementation Overview

### Solution Design

The plan addresses execution compliance through 5 key changes:

#### 1. Strengthen Agent Directive
**Current** (orchestrate.md:536-560):
```markdown
**CRITICAL: Create Report File**

You MUST create a research report file using the Write tool...
```

**Proposed**:
```markdown
# ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENT - File Creation is Your Primary Task

Before beginning research, you will create a report file. This is not optional.

**STEP 1: Create Report File**
Use the Write tool immediately to create the report file.

**STEP 2: Conduct Research**
Fill in the report content.

**STEP 3: Return File Confirmation**
Return ONLY: REPORT_CREATED: {path}

DO NOT return a summary. Orchestrator will extract summary by reading your report file.
```

**Changes**:
- Make file creation the PRIMARY task (STEP 1), not a side requirement
- Change return format from `REPORT_PATH:` to `REPORT_CREATED:` (emphasizes action taken)
- Remove "Secondary Output: Brief summary" (orchestrator extracts from file)
- Explicit "DO NOT return summary text" instruction

#### 2. Add Explicit Write Tool Verification
**Current**: Only checks if `REPORT_PATH` text is returned
**Proposed**: Verify Write tool was actually used in agent's tool trace

```bash
# Check if Write tool was invoked
if ! grep -q "Write.*${REPORT_PATH}" <<< "$AGENT_TOOL_TRACE"; then
  echo "⚠️  Agent did not use Write tool"
  NEEDS_FALLBACK=true
fi
```

#### 3. Integrate Metadata Extraction
**Current**: Orchestrator relies on agent's text summary for context
**Proposed**: Extract summary from file using `extract_report_metadata()` utility

```bash
# Source metadata extraction utility
source "${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}/.claude/lib/metadata-extraction.sh"

# Extract metadata from created report file
METADATA=$(extract_report_metadata "$REPORT_PATH")
SUMMARY=$(echo "$METADATA" | jq -r '.summary')  # Max 50 words
TITLE=$(echo "$METADATA" | jq -r '.title')
```

**Benefits**:
- Consistent summary format (utility controls extraction, not agent)
- Guaranteed 50-word limit
- 99% context reduction (5000 chars → 250 chars)

#### 4. Implement Fallback Mechanism
**Current**: If agent doesn't create file, workflow continues with missing artifact
**Proposed**: Orchestrator automatically creates file from agent's text output

```bash
# If file doesn't exist, create it using agent's output
if [ ! -f "$REPORT_PATH" ]; then
  echo "⚠️  Report file not created by agent. Creating fallback report..."

  # Extract summary from agent output
  AGENT_SUMMARY=$(echo "$AGENT_OUTPUT" | head -20 | grep -v '^$' | head -5)

  # Create report file with agent's findings
  cat > "$REPORT_PATH" <<EOF
# ${topic}

## Metadata
- **Date**: $(date -u +%Y-%m-%d)
- **Agent**: research-specialist (fallback creation)

## Executive Summary
$AGENT_SUMMARY

## Findings
$AGENT_OUTPUT
EOF

  echo "✓ Fallback report created"
fi
```

**Impact**: Reports ALWAYS exist, regardless of agent compliance

#### 5. Updated Verification Flow

**New sequence**:
1. Check if Write tool was used (agent tool trace)
2. Check if file exists at expected path
3. If missing: Trigger fallback creation
4. Extract metadata from file (guaranteed to exist after fallback)
5. Store minimal context (path + 50-word summary)
6. Prune agent's full output (keep only metadata)

**Result**: 100% report creation rate, 95%+ context reduction

### Technical Decisions

**Decision 1: Fallback as Safety Net, Not Primary Path**
- Rationale: Strengthened directive should improve agent compliance over time
- Fallback ensures reliability while agents learn
- Monitoring fallback usage provides compliance metrics

**Decision 2: Metadata Extraction from Files**
- Rationale: Consistent format regardless of agent text quality
- Utility-controlled extraction ensures 50-word limit
- Full reports available on disk for deep dives

**Decision 3: Strengthen Directive, Don't Punish Non-Compliance**
- Rationale: Fallback creates report instead of failing workflow
- Graceful degradation maintains workflow continuity
- Agent compliance expected to improve with clearer instructions

**Decision 4: Integration with Existing Utilities**
- Rationale: `extract_report_metadata()` already tested and proven in hierarchical agents
- Reuse working code instead of reimplementing
- Consistency across all metadata extraction

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well
1. **Parallel Research**: 3 specialized agents efficiently analyzed different aspects
2. **Existing Utilities**: Metadata extraction utility already exists and works well
3. **Clear Problem Identification**: Issue is execution compliance, not missing mechanism
4. **Comprehensive Design**: 5-part solution addresses root cause and provides fallback

### Challenges Encountered
1. **Surprising Discovery**: Expected to find missing mechanism, but everything already exists
   - Resolution: Identified execution compliance as the real issue

2. **Agent Behavior**: Agents ignoring "CRITICAL" directive
   - Resolution: Strengthen directive, make file creation PRIMARY task, add fallback

3. **Context Extraction**: Need to extract summaries from files, not agent text
   - Resolution: Integrate existing `extract_report_metadata()` utility

### Recommendations for Future

1. **Agent Compliance Monitoring**: Track fallback usage rate to measure agent improvement
   - Benefit: Data-driven agent prompt tuning
   - Action: Log fallback creation events with timestamps

2. **Enhanced Fallback**: Use spec-updater agent to improve fallback reports
   - Benefit: Higher quality fallback reports
   - Action: Future enhancement after basic fallback proven

3. **Directive Patterns**: Apply "PRIMARY task" pattern to other agent instructions
   - Benefit: Improved compliance across all agent types
   - Action: Audit other commands for similar issues

4. **Metadata Extraction Everywhere**: Use utility for all artifact summaries
   - Benefit: Consistent format, guaranteed context reduction
   - Action: Refactor other commands to use metadata extraction

## Detailed Findings

### Current /orchestrate Implementation Analysis

**Path Calculation** (Already Exists - orchestrate.md:504-522):
```bash
# Pre-calculate absolute paths BEFORE agent invocation
for topic in "${TOPICS[@]}"; do
  TOPIC_DIR="${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}/specs/reports/${topic}"
  mkdir -p "$TOPIC_DIR"
  NEXT_NUM=$(get_next_artifact_number "$TOPIC_DIR")
  REPORT_PATH="${TOPIC_DIR}/${NEXT_NUM}_analysis.md"
  REPORT_PATHS["$topic"]="$REPORT_PATH"
done
```

**Benefits**:
- Eliminates path mismatch errors (agents use exact paths)
- Ensures consistent numbering across topics
- Prevents race conditions in parallel execution
- Enables verification of expected file locations

**Agent Instruction** (Already Exists - orchestrate.md:536-560):
```markdown
**CRITICAL: Create Report File**

You MUST create a research report file using the Write tool at this EXACT path:
**Report Path**: ${REPORT_PATHS["topic_name"]}

DO NOT: Return only a summary
DO: Use Write tool with exact path above
    Return: REPORT_PATH: ${REPORT_PATHS["topic_name"]}
```

**Problem**: Despite explicit instruction, agents return text summaries instead of creating files

**Verification Logic** (Already Exists - orchestrate.md:656-674):
```bash
# Extract REPORT_PATH from agent output
EXTRACTED_PATH=$(echo "$AGENT_OUTPUT" | grep -oP 'REPORT_PATH:\s*\K/.+' | head -1)

if [ -z "$EXTRACTED_PATH" ]; then
  echo "⚠️  Agent did not return REPORT_PATH"
  EXTRACTED_PATH="${REPORT_PATHS[$topic]}"  # Use pre-calculated
fi
```

**Problem**: Only checks for text `REPORT_PATH:`, doesn't verify file actually exists or Write tool was used

### Metadata Extraction Utilities

**Available Functions** (.claude/lib/metadata-extraction.sh):

1. **`extract_report_metadata(report_path)`** (lines 13-87):
   - Extracts: title (first # heading)
   - Extracts: 50-word summary (from Executive Summary or first paragraph)
   - Extracts: file paths mentioned in report
   - Extracts: top 3-5 recommendations
   - Returns: JSON metadata object

2. **`extract_plan_metadata(plan_path)`** (lines 89+):
   - Extracts: title, date, phase count, complexity, time estimate
   - Used for adaptive planning complexity assessment

3. **Context Reduction Metrics**:
   - Per-artifact reduction: 99% (5000 tokens → 250 tokens)
   - Per-phase reduction: 87-97%
   - Full workflow context usage: <30% target achieved
   - Time savings: 40-80% via parallel execution + context reduction

### The Fix: Execution Compliance Strategy

**5-Part Solution**:

| Component | Current State | Proposed Change | Impact |
|-----------|---------------|-----------------|--------|
| Agent Directive | "CRITICAL" warning text | "PRIMARY task" with STEPS 1-2-3 | Clearer requirement |
| Return Format | `REPORT_PATH: /path` | `REPORT_CREATED: /path` | Emphasizes action taken |
| Summary Extraction | Agent text output | `extract_report_metadata()` from file | 99% context reduction |
| File Verification | Check for text `REPORT_PATH:` | Check file exists + Write tool used | True verification |
| Fallback | None (workflow fails) | Create file from agent output | 100% report creation |

**Expected Results**:
- 100% report creation rate (via fallback)
- 95%+ context reduction (metadata extraction)
- Improved agent compliance over time (clearer directive)
- Consistent summary format (utility-controlled extraction)

## Next Steps

### For User Review
1. **Review Implementation Plan**: [002_fix_research_agent_report_creation.md](../plans/002_fix_research_agent_report_creation.md)
2. **Approve Approach**: Confirm 5-part solution (strengthen directive + fallback + metadata extraction)
3. **Prioritize Phases**: Decide if all 3 phases should be implemented together or incrementally

### For Implementation
1. **Execute Phase 1**: Strengthen directive and add fallback mechanism
2. **Test Fallback**: Verify reports created even when agents don't comply
3. **Execute Phase 2**: Integrate metadata extraction utility
4. **Execute Phase 3**: Comprehensive testing and documentation

### For Future Consideration
1. **Agent Compliance Monitoring**: Track fallback usage rate
2. **Enhanced Fallback**: Use spec-updater agent to improve fallback reports
3. **Directive Patterns**: Apply "PRIMARY task" pattern to other commands
4. **Metadata Everywhere**: Use utility for all artifact summaries

## Notes

### Verification Evidence

The research phase provided specific file references for all findings:

**Existing Mechanism Evidence**:
- Path calculation: orchestrate.md lines 504-522
- Agent directive: orchestrate.md lines 536-560
- Verification logic: orchestrate.md lines 656-674
- Agent definition: research-specialist.md with Write tool access

**Metadata Extraction Utility**:
- Location: /home/benjamin/.config/.claude/lib/metadata-extraction.sh
- Function: `extract_report_metadata()` (lines 13-87)
- Usage: Hierarchical agents doc references it extensively
- Performance: 99% context reduction (5000 → 250 tokens)

**Problem Evidence**:
- User report: "subagents did not create reports that I can find at all"
- Current check: Only verifies text `REPORT_PATH:`, not file existence
- Root cause: Agents prefer returning text over using Write tool

### Implementation Risk: Low

**Why Low Risk?**
1. **Fallback Safety Net**: Reports always created, even if agent doesn't comply
2. **Existing Utilities**: Metadata extraction already tested in hierarchical agents
3. **Incremental Phases**: Each phase independently testable
4. **No Breaking Changes**: Fallback ensures backward compatibility
5. **Clear Solution**: 5-part fix addresses known root cause

**Potential Issues**:
- Agent compliance may not improve (but fallback handles this)
- Metadata extraction might fail on malformed reports (but fallback reports have known structure)
- Performance impact of fallback creation (but file creation is fast, <1 second)

### Context Reduction Example

**Before** (Agent text in memory):
```
AGENT_OUTPUT (5000 chars):
"Research findings: The codebase currently implements authentication using
session-based cookies with HTTP-only flags. Analysis of the auth middleware
shows that sessions are stored in Redis with a 30-minute timeout. Security
audit revealed several concerns: no refresh token mechanism, vulnerable to
session fixation attacks, lacks rate limiting on login attempts...
[...4800 more characters...]"

Orchestrator stores full text: 5000 tokens
```

**After** (Metadata from file):
```
METADATA (250 chars):
{
  "title": "Authentication Patterns Analysis",
  "summary": "Session-based auth with Redis storage. 30-min timeout. Security concerns: no refresh tokens, session fixation risk, no rate limiting.",
  "path": "specs/reports/auth/001_analysis.md",
  "recommendations": ["Add refresh tokens", "Implement rate limiting"]
}

Orchestrator stores metadata: 250 tokens
Context reduction: 95%
```
