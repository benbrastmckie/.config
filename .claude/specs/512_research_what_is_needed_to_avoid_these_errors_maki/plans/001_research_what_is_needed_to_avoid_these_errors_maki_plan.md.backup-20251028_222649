## Overview

The /research command currently fails with bash associative array syntax errors when attempting to iterate over subtopic arrays (Report 001). Additionally, it violates several command architecture standards that prevent agent delegation and file creation (Report 003). This plan implements MINIMAL changes to fix the immediate bash syntax error and apply only the most critical reliability improvements without unnecessary complexity.

**Core Issues**:
1. Bash syntax error in STEP 2 (lines 155-196 of research.md) due to array iteration in single code block
2. Missing "EXECUTE NOW" directives causing bash blocks to be interpreted as documentation
3. Missing MANDATORY VERIFICATION checkpoints causing silent file creation failures

**Approach**: Distill to high-quality changes that work without fail. Focus on the critical path: fix bash error → ensure execution → verify results.

## Research Summary

**Key Findings from Research Reports**:

From **001_bash_syntax_error_analysis.md**:
- Root cause: Bash tool cannot handle `"${SUBTOPICS[@]}"` array iteration in single large code block
- Tool attempts to expand arrays during eval construction, resulting in malformed syntax
- Solution: Split code block at array iteration boundary (proven successful in second attempt)
- Minimal fix: Split lines 155-196 into two sequential bash invocations

From **002_research_command_architecture_analysis.md**:
- Missing STEP 0 library sourcing with verification (80+ line gap vs /coordinate)
- Path calculation redundancy (47 lines could be 10 lines via utility)
- NO recommendation to adopt complex patterns from /coordinate (904 vs 1836 lines)
- Focus on adding verification helpers only, not restructuring

From **003_documentation_standards_review.md**:
- Current compliance: 0/5 standards (0%)
- Critical violations: Standard 11 (agent invocation), Standard 0 (execution enforcement)
- Verification-Fallback pattern completely missing
- Fix priority: Standard 11 → Verification → Bash directives → Error messages
- Expected improvement: 0% → >90% delegation rate, 0% → 100% file creation

**Recommended Approach Based on Research**:
User explicitly requested "minimal changes" and "avoid needless complexity." Therefore:
- Phase 1: Fix immediate bash syntax error ONLY
- Phase 2: Add minimal execution enforcement (EXECUTE NOW directives)
- Phase 3: Add verification checkpoints (no full fallback pattern yet)
- SKIP: Library consolidation, helper functions, comprehensive error messages (defer to future iteration)

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Bash syntax error eliminated (no "syntax error near unexpected token" errors)
- [ ] /research command executes without fatal errors on test topics
- [ ] Bash code blocks execute (not interpreted as documentation)
- [ ] Path calculation completes successfully
- [ ] Report paths are absolute and correctly formatted
- [ ] Manual testing confirms workflow completes end-to-end
- [ ] No regression in existing functionality

## Technical Design

**Architecture Preservation**:
- Keep existing 7-step structure (STEP 1-7)
- Keep existing inline path calculation (defer library consolidation)
- Keep existing agent invocation structure
- Keep existing metadata extraction pattern

**Minimal Changes**:

1. **Bash Code Block Split** (Phase 1)
   - Split STEP 2 bash block at array iteration boundary
   - First block: Directory creation + for loop iteration
   - Second block: Path verification
   - Pattern: Mirrors successful recovery pattern from lines 82-89 of error output

2. **Execution Enforcement** (Phase 2)
   - Add `**EXECUTE NOW**: USE the Bash tool` before each bash code block
   - Target: STEP 2 path calculation block (now 2 blocks after split)
   - No other directive changes (minimize scope)

3. **Basic Verification** (Phase 3)
   - Add simple file existence check after path calculation
   - Echo verification success message
   - Exit on failure (no complex fallback yet)
   - Pattern: Lightweight checkpoint, not full Verification-Fallback pattern

**What NOT to Change**:
- Do NOT consolidate path calculation to library utilities (Report 002 Rec 3 - deferred)
- Do NOT add verification helper function (Report 002 Rec 4 - deferred)
- Do NOT add STEP 0 library sourcing (Report 002 Rec 2 - deferred)
- Do NOT restructure agent invocations (Report 003 Priority 1 - deferred)
- Do NOT add 5-component error messages (Report 003 Priority 4 - deferred)

**Rationale**: User requested "distill to high-quality changes" and "avoid needless complexity." These deferred items are improvements but not fixes. Apply after establishing baseline reliability.

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Fix Bash Associative Array Syntax Error
dependencies: []

**Objective**: Split the problematic bash code block to eliminate syntax error

**Complexity**: Low

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Read current /research command file (file: /home/benjamin/.config/.claude/commands/research.md, lines 155-213)
- [ ] Identify exact split point (after for loop completes, before verification loop)
- [ ] Use Edit tool to split single bash block into two sequential blocks
  - First block ends after: `echo "RESEARCH_SUBDIR='$RESEARCH_SUBDIR'"`
  - Add closing ``` and new bash block opening ```bash
  - Second block starts with: `# Verify all paths are absolute`
- [ ] Verify edit syntax is correct (read back edited section)
- [ ] Preserve all existing logic (no functionality changes)

**Testing**:
```bash
# Verify syntax of edited file
bash -n .claude/commands/research.md 2>&1 | grep -i "syntax error"
# Should return no errors

# Check split was applied correctly
grep -A2 "RESEARCH_SUBDIR=" .claude/commands/research.md | grep '```'
# Should show closing fence after variable echo
```

**Expected Duration**: 30 minutes

**Phase 1 Completion Requirements**:
- [ ] All phase tasks marked [x]
- [ ] Bash syntax error eliminated in edited file
- [ ] Split point preserves all existing logic
- [ ] No unintended changes to other sections
- [ ] Update this plan file with phase completion status

### Phase 2: Add Execution Enforcement Directives
dependencies: [1]

**Objective**: Ensure bash code blocks execute (not interpreted as documentation)

**Complexity**: Low

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Locate STEP 2 section in /research command (now contains 2 bash blocks after Phase 1)
- [ ] Add directive before first bash block (path calculation):
  ```markdown
  **EXECUTE NOW**: USE the Bash tool to calculate report paths:
  ```
- [ ] Add directive before second bash block (verification):
  ```markdown
  **EXECUTE NOW**: USE the Bash tool to verify all paths:
  ```
- [ ] Update instructional text to reflect sequential execution requirement
- [ ] Verify no other bash blocks need directives (scan entire file)

**Testing**:
```bash
# Check directives are present
grep -B1 '^```bash' .claude/commands/research.md | grep "EXECUTE NOW"
# Should find 2 matches in STEP 2

# Verify directive format matches standards
grep "EXECUTE NOW.*USE the Bash tool" .claude/commands/research.md
# Should find correct imperative phrasing
```

**Expected Duration**: 20 minutes

**Phase 2 Completion Requirements**:
- [ ] All phase tasks marked [x]
- [ ] Execution directives added to both bash blocks
- [ ] Directive phrasing follows Standard 0 format
- [ ] Instructional text updated for clarity
- [ ] Update this plan file with phase completion status

### Phase 3: Add Basic Verification Checkpoints
dependencies: [1, 2]

**Objective**: Verify path calculation completes successfully

**Complexity**: Low

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Add verification checkpoint after second bash block in STEP 2
  ```markdown
  **CHECKPOINT**: Path calculation complete. Verify before proceeding to agent invocation.

  Expected state:
  - RESEARCH_SUBDIR variable set to absolute path
  - ${#SUBTOPIC_REPORT_PATHS[@]} equals number of subtopics
  - All paths are absolute (start with /)

  If verification fails, stop execution and review path calculation output.
  ```
- [ ] Update STEP 2 completion criteria to reference checkpoint
- [ ] Ensure checkpoint appears BEFORE STEP 3 (agent invocation)
- [ ] Add similar checkpoint pattern to STEP 4 (after agent execution) if time permits

**Testing**:
```bash
# Manual end-to-end test
/research "test research topic with 2-3 subtopics" 2>&1 | tee test_output.log

# Verify checkpoints appear in output
grep "CHECKPOINT" test_output.log
# Should show checkpoint messages

# Verify no bash syntax errors
grep "syntax error" test_output.log
# Should return nothing

# Verify path calculation succeeded
grep "✓ VERIFIED: All paths are absolute" test_output.log
# Should find success message
```

**Expected Duration**: 30 minutes

**Phase 3 Completion Requirements**:
- [ ] All phase tasks marked [x]
- [ ] Verification checkpoint added after path calculation
- [ ] Checkpoint format is clear and actionable
- [ ] Manual testing confirms workflow completes
- [ ] No bash syntax errors in test run
- [ ] Git commit created: `feat(512): complete Phase 3 - Add Basic Verification Checkpoints`
- [ ] Update this plan file with phase completion status

## Testing Strategy

**Unit Testing** (per-phase):
- Phase 1: Bash syntax validation (`bash -n` on command file)
- Phase 2: Directive presence validation (`grep` for EXECUTE NOW)
- Phase 3: Checkpoint presence validation (manual test run)

**Integration Testing** (after Phase 3):
- Run /research command with simple test topic (2-3 subtopics)
- Verify no bash syntax errors in output
- Verify path calculation completes
- Verify CHECKPOINT messages appear
- Compare output structure to expected (no TODO files, correct directory structure)

**Regression Testing**:
- Test with same query that originally failed
- Verify error no longer appears
- Confirm file creation in correct locations

**Success Metrics**:
- Bash syntax error: 100% eliminated
- Path calculation: 100% success rate
- Execution enforcement: 100% compliance (all bash blocks execute)
- Manual workflow: 100% completion rate (no fatal errors)

**Testing Commands**:
```bash
# Quick syntax check
bash -n .claude/commands/research.md

# Integration test
/research "research best practices for command reliability"

# Check for expected output patterns
grep "CHECKPOINT" <output>
grep "✓ VERIFIED" <output>
! grep "syntax error" <output>  # Should NOT appear
```

## Documentation Requirements

**Inline Documentation** (in /research command file):
- Add comment at STEP 2 explaining why code block is split
- Reference Report 001 (bash syntax error analysis) for context
- Note that future optimization may consolidate to library utilities

**No New Documentation Files**:
- User requested minimal changes
- Defer comprehensive documentation to future iteration
- Existing standards in CLAUDE.md are sufficient

**Plan Update**:
- Mark phases complete as work progresses
- Update estimated hours if actual time differs significantly
- Note any deviations from plan in implementation summary

## Dependencies

**External Dependencies**:
- None (changes are isolated to research.md command file)

**Library Dependencies** (existing, no new ones):
- `.claude/lib/topic-decomposition.sh` (already sourced in STEP 1)
- `.claude/lib/artifact-creation.sh` (already sourced in STEP 1)
- `.claude/lib/metadata-extraction.sh` (already sourced in STEP 1)

**File Dependencies**:
- `/home/benjamin/.config/.claude/commands/research.md` (modification target)
- Research reports in `../reports/` (informational only)

**No New Files Created**:
- All changes are edits to existing research.md file
- No new library utilities
- No new helper functions
- No new documentation files

## Future Improvements (Deferred)

**Not in Scope for This Plan** (defer to future iterations):

1. **STEP 0 Library Sourcing** (Report 002 Rec 2)
   - Estimated effort: 30 minutes
   - Benefit: Fail-fast on missing libraries
   - Rationale for deferral: Not causing current failures

2. **Path Calculation Consolidation** (Report 002 Rec 3)
   - Estimated effort: 1 hour
   - Benefit: 47 → 10 lines (80% reduction)
   - Rationale for deferral: Requires testing, not a bug fix

3. **Verification Helper Function** (Report 002 Rec 4)
   - Estimated effort: 1.5 hours
   - Benefit: Consistent error messages
   - Rationale for deferral: Cosmetic improvement

4. **Standard 11 Compliance** (Report 003 Priority 1)
   - Estimated effort: 2 hours
   - Benefit: >90% delegation rate improvement
   - Rationale for deferral: Requires restructuring agent invocations

5. **5-Component Error Messages** (Report 003 Priority 4)
   - Estimated effort: 30 minutes
   - Benefit: Better debugging experience
   - Rationale for deferral: User requested minimal changes

**When to Apply Deferred Improvements**:
- After baseline reliability established (this plan)
- When user requests optimization (not just bug fixes)
- During comprehensive refactoring effort
- When similar patterns needed across multiple commands

## Notes

**Design Philosophy**:
This plan follows the user's explicit guidance: "Fix /research command errors with minimal changes to improve reliability and avoid needless complexity." Therefore, we:
- Fix ONLY the critical bash syntax error
- Add ONLY the minimum execution enforcement needed
- Add ONLY basic verification (no full Verification-Fallback pattern)
- Defer all optimizations and architectural improvements

**Why This Approach**:
1. User explicitly requested "minimal changes"
2. User explicitly requested "avoid needless complexity"
3. Research reports recommend larger changes, but user context overrides
4. Establish baseline reliability first, optimize later

**Deviation from Research Recommendations**:
- Report 002 recommends library consolidation (deferred)
- Report 003 recommends full Standard 11 compliance (deferred)
- Report 003 recommends comprehensive verification pattern (simplified)
- Rationale: User's "minimal changes" constraint takes precedence

**Success Criteria**:
This plan succeeds if the /research command:
1. Executes without bash syntax errors
2. Completes path calculation successfully
3. Runs end-to-end without fatal errors

It does NOT need to achieve >90% delegation rate or 100% file creation reliability in this iteration. Those are future improvements.
