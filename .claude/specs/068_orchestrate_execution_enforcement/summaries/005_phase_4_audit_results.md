## Pattern Analysis

### Missing Patterns (Common Across All Commands)

1. **Imperative Language** (0/20 points across all)
   - No "YOU MUST" markers
   - No "EXECUTE NOW" markers
   - Descriptive language throughout

2. **Step Dependencies** (0/15 points across all)
   - No sequential step structure
   - No "STEP N (REQUIRED)" markers
   - Tasks listed without dependencies

3. **Verification Checkpoints** (0-5/20 points)
   - /implement: Has some checkpoints (5pts)
   - Others: No mandatory verification

4. **Fallback Mechanisms** (0/10 points across all)
   - No fallback for agent failures
   - No guaranteed success mechanisms

5. **Critical Requirements** (0/10 points across all)
   - No "CRITICAL" or "ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENT" markers
   - All instructions advisory

### Present Patterns (Partial Credit)

1. **Error Handling** (variable)
   - /implement: 10/10 (has error handling)
   - /plan, /expand, /debug, /document: 0/10

2. **Path Verification** (variable)
   - /implement: 10/10 (mentions paths)
   - Others: 0/10

## /implement Command (Priority 1)

**Score**: 30/100 (Grade: F)

### Pattern Breakdown
- Imperative Language: 0/20
- Step Dependencies: 0/15
- Verification Checkpoints: 5/20 (some checkpoints present)
- Fallback Mechanisms: 0/10
- Critical Requirements: 0/10
- Path Verification: 10/10 (✓ has path checks)
- File Creation: 5/10 (mentioned but not enforced)
- Return Format: 0/5
- Passive Voice: -5/0 (9 instances)
- Error Handling: 10/10 (✓ has error handling)

### Key Issues
- Descriptive language ("This command will...")
- No step-by-step enforcement
- Agent invocations not enforced (9 agent calls)
- No mandatory verification checkpoints
- No fallback for agent failures

### Estimated Fix Effort
**8-10 hours** (562 lines, 9 agent invocations)

---

## /plan Command (Priority 2)

**Score**: 10/100 (Grade: F)

### Pattern Breakdown
- Imperative Language: 0/20
- Step Dependencies: 0/15
- Verification Checkpoints: 0/20
- Fallback Mechanisms: 0/10
- Critical Requirements: 0/10
- Path Verification: 0/10
- File Creation: 0/10
- Return Format: 0/5
- Passive Voice: -10/0 (16 instances - high)
- Error Handling: 0/10

### Key Issues
- Heavy passive voice (16 instances)
- No enforcement at any level
- 5 agent invocations not enforced
- Complexity calculation not mandatory
- No verification of plan file creation

### Estimated Fix Effort
**6-8 hours** (930 lines, 5 agent invocations)

---

## /expand Command (Priority 3)

**Score**: 20/100 (Grade: F)

### Pattern Breakdown
- Partial credit for some patterns
- Major gaps in verification and enforcement

### Key Issues
- Auto-analysis not enforced
- Parallel expansion not mandatory
- No file verification

### Estimated Fix Effort
**4-6 hours** (678 lines, parallel patterns)

---

## /debug Command (Priority 4)

**Score**: 10/100 (Grade: F)

### Key Issues
- Parallel investigation not enforced
- debug-analyst invocations need strengthening
- No mandatory report verification

### Estimated Fix Effort
**4-6 hours** (564 lines, parallel hypotheses)

---

## /document Command (Priority 5)

**Score**: 0/100 (Grade: F)

### Key Issues
- No enforcement patterns present
- Cross-reference verification not mandatory
- Documentation updates optional

### Estimated Fix Effort
**3-4 hours** (cross-reference focus)

---

## Phase 4 Conclusions

### Findings
1. **All priority commands need enforcement**: None meet minimum standards (60/100)
2. **Common patterns missing**: Imperative language, step dependencies, verification
3. **Agent invocations weak**: No enforcement at delegation points
4. **No fallback mechanisms**: Agent failures not handled

### Recommendations

**Priority 1: /implement**
- Most critical (9 agent invocations)
- Highest usage frequency
- Most impact on reliability
- Fix first

**Priority 2: /plan**
- Second highest agent usage (5 invocations)
- Critical for workflow initiation
- Complexity calculation needs enforcement
- Fix second

**Priority 3-5: /expand, /debug, /document**
- Lower complexity
- Apply proven patterns
- Fix incrementally

---

## Next Steps (Phase 5)

### Immediate Action
Focus on /implement command:
1. Add imperative language throughout
2. Structure as sequential steps
3. Enforce all 9 agent invocations
4. Add mandatory verification checkpoints
5. Implement fallback mechanisms
6. Add checkpoint reporting

### Success Criteria
- /implement score: 30 → 90+ (Grade A)
- All agent invocations enforced
- Fallback mechanisms operational
- Verification checkpoints mandatory

**Phase 4 Status**: COMPLETE (Audit performed)
**Phase 5 Status**: IN PROGRESS (Starting with /implement)
