## Overview

The /orchestrate command, other high-priority commands (/implement, /plan, /expand), and subagent prompts suffer from **execution enforcement gaps** where Claude Code may interpret behavioral instructions loosely, skip critical steps, or simplify procedures, leading to incomplete execution (e.g., research agents not creating report files).

**Root Cause**: Command files and subagent prompts contain behavioral instructions written in descriptive language that Claude treats as guidance rather than mandatory directives. Critical operations like file creation, path pre-calculation, and verification lack explicit enforcement markers.

**Research Findings**:
- **Commands at risk**: /implement (9 agent invocations), /plan (5 agents), /expand (parallel coordination), /debug (parallel hypotheses)
- **Subagent patterns**: 25 agent prompts use "I am" declarations instead of "YOU MUST" directives
- **Critical gaps**: File creation requirements lack "EXECUTE NOW" markers, verification steps are optional, sequential steps lack ordering enforcement

**Solution**: Apply **Standard 0 (Execution Enforcement)** from command_architecture_standards.md to systematically strengthen:
1. **Command files**: /orchestrate, /implement, /plan, /expand, /debug (5 priority commands)
2. **Subagent prompts**: 6 priority agents (research-specialist, plan-architect, code-writer, spec-updater, implementation-researcher, debug-analyst)
3. **All commands**: Systematic audit of 20 commands with enforcement patterns

**Enforcement Patterns**:
1. Imperative language patterns ("YOU MUST", "EXECUTE NOW", "MANDATORY")
2. Explicit execution blocks with verification
3. Non-negotiable agent prompt templates
4. Checkpoint reporting requirements
5. Fallback mechanisms for agent non-compliance

## Technical Design

### Execution Enforcement Patterns (from Standard 0)

#### Pattern 1: Direct Execution Blocks
```markdown
**EXECUTE NOW - [Action Name]**

Run this code block [BEFORE/AFTER] [trigger]:

\`\`\`bash
[complete, copy-paste ready code]
\`\`\`

**Verification**: Confirm [outcome] before continuing.
```

#### Pattern 2: Mandatory Verification Checkpoints
```markdown
**MANDATORY VERIFICATION - [What to Verify]**

After [event], YOU MUST execute this verification:

\`\`\`bash
if [ ! -f "$EXPECTED_FILE" ]; then
  echo "CRITICAL: [Error description]"
  # Fallback action
fi
echo "✓ Verified: [what was verified]"
\`\`\`

**REQUIREMENT**: This verification is NOT optional. Execute it exactly as shown.
```

#### Pattern 3: Non-Negotiable Agent Prompts
```markdown
**AGENT INVOCATION - Use THIS EXACT TEMPLATE (No modifications)**

\`\`\`yaml
Task {
  subagent_type: "general-purpose"
  description: "[task with context]"
  prompt: "
    [Complete prompt with ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENT markers]
    [STEP 1, STEP 2, STEP 3 structure]
    [CRITICAL requirements]
  "
}
\`\`\`

**ENFORCEMENT**: Copy this template verbatim. Do NOT simplify or paraphrase the prompt.
```

#### Pattern 4: Checkpoint Reporting
```markdown
**CHECKPOINT REQUIREMENT**

After completing [phase/step], report status:

\`\`\`
CHECKPOINT: [Phase] complete
- [Metric 1]: [value]
- [Metric 2]: [value]
- All [items] verified: ✓
- Proceeding to: [Next phase]
\`\`\`

This reporting is MANDATORY and confirms proper execution.
```

#### Pattern 5: Fallback Mechanisms
```markdown
### [Operation] with Fallback

**Primary Path**: Agent follows instructions and creates [output]
**Fallback Path**: Command creates [output] from agent response if agent doesn't comply

**Implementation**:
\`\`\`bash
# After agent completes
if [ ! -f "$EXPECTED_OUTPUT" ]; then
  echo "Agent didn't create file. Executing fallback..."
  cat > "$EXPECTED_OUTPUT" <<EOF
[fallback content structure]
EOF
fi
\`\`\`

**Guarantee**: [Output] exists regardless of agent behavior.
```

### Subagent Prompt Enforcement Patterns

Research identified these critical gaps in subagent prompts:

#### Current Weak Patterns (To Replace)
```markdown
❌ "I am a specialized agent focused on..."
❌ "My role is to analyze..."
❌ "Create structured markdown report files using Write tool"
❌ "Verify links after moving"
❌ "should", "may", "can" (conditional language)
❌ "Consider adding..." (optional suggestions)
```

#### Enforcement Patterns (To Apply)
```markdown
✅ "YOU MUST analyze..."
✅ "EXECUTE NOW - Create Report File"
✅ "MANDATORY VERIFICATION - All links functional"
✅ "ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENT", "YOU WILL", "YOU SHALL"
✅ "STEP 1 (REQUIRED BEFORE STEP 2): Starting research..."
✅ "THIS EXACT TEMPLATE (No modifications)"
```

#### Example Transformation
**Before** (research-specialist.md):
```markdown
I am a specialized agent focused on thorough research and analysis.

My role is to:
- Investigate the codebase for patterns
- Create structured markdown report files using Write tool
- Emit progress markers during research
```

**After** (with enforcement):
```markdown
**YOU MUST perform these exact steps in sequence:**

**STEP 1 (REQUIRED BEFORE STEP 2) - Pre-Calculate Report Path**

EXECUTE NOW - Calculate the exact file path where you will write the report:

\`\`\`bash
REPORT_PATH="specs/reports/NNN_topic.md"
echo "Report will be written to: $REPORT_PATH"
\`\`\`

**STEP 2 (REQUIRED BEFORE STEP 3) - Conduct Research**

YOU MUST investigate the codebase for patterns using these tools...

**STEP 3 (ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENT) - Create Report File**

**EXECUTE NOW - Create Report File**

YOU MUST use the Write tool to create the report file at the exact path calculated in Step 1.

**MANDATORY VERIFICATION - Report File Exists**

After creating the report, YOU MUST verify:

\`\`\`bash
test -f "$REPORT_PATH" || echo "CRITICAL: Report file not created"
\`\`\`

**CHECKPOINT REQUIREMENT**

EMIT this progress marker:
\`\`\`
PROGRESS: Report created at $REPORT_PATH
\`\`\`
```

### /orchestrate Research Phase Fix Strategy

**Current Problems** (identified in root cause analysis):
1. Descriptive language: "Research agents are invoked" vs "YOU MUST invoke"
2. Optional-sounding directives: "Create report file" vs "ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENT"
3. No path pre-calculation enforcement
4. No file existence verification
5. No fallback when agents don't comply
6. Agent prompts may be simplified by Claude during invocation

**Fix Approach**:
```
Current Flow:                          Fixed Flow:
────────────────────────────────────   ────────────────────────────────────
1. Describe research phase             1. EXECUTE NOW: Calculate paths
2. Invoke agents (vague prompt)        2. THIS EXACT TEMPLATE: Agent prompts
3. Hope agents create files            3. MANDATORY VERIFICATION: File exists
4. Extract paths from agent output     4. Fallback if verification fails
5. Continue to planning                5. CHECKPOINT: Report completion
                                       6. Continue to planning
```

### Cross-Reference Metadata Pattern

This plan references external documentation. When implementing, use metadata extraction to minimize context usage:

**Standards Documents** (metadata-only references):
- Path: `.claude/docs/reference/command_architecture_standards.md`
- Standard: Standard 0 (Execution Enforcement)
- Relevant Sections: Patterns 1-5, Agent invocation patterns
- Context Reduction: 95% (250 tokens vs 5000 tokens)

**Extraction Pattern**:
```bash
# Extract metadata from standards documents
METADATA=$(extract_report_metadata "$STANDARDS_PATH")
# Returns: {path, 50-word summary, key_patterns[]}

# Use Read tool selectively for specific patterns only
```

Use metadata-only passing when invoking agents or creating cross-references to reduce context consumption from 5000+ tokens to <300 tokens per reference.

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Fix /orchestrate Research Phase [PRIORITY 1] [EXPANDED] [COMPLETED]
**Objective**: Guarantee research report file creation through execution enforcement
**Dependencies**: []
**Complexity**: High
**Risk**: Medium (changes core orchestration flow)
**Estimated Time**: 6-8 hours
**Status**: COMPLETED
**Completion Date**: 2025-10-19
**Commit**: c2a00035

**Summary**: Transform /orchestrate research phase from descriptive guidance to imperative enforcement. Add "EXECUTE NOW" markers for path pre-calculation, "THIS EXACT TEMPLATE" for agent invocations, "MANDATORY VERIFICATION" checkpoints after agent completion, metadata extraction, and comprehensive checkpoint reporting. Target: 100% file creation rate via enforcement + fallback mechanisms.

**Key Deliverables**:
- Path pre-calculation with verification
- Agent template enforcement (no simplification)
- Mandatory verification + fallback creation
- Metadata extraction (99% context reduction)
- Research phase completion checkpoint

For detailed implementation tasks, testing strategy, and before/after examples, see:
**[Phase 1 Details](phase_1_orchestrate_research.md)**

### Phase 2: Fix /orchestrate Other Phases [EXPANDED]
**Objective**: Apply execution enforcement to planning, implementation, documentation phases
**Dependencies**: [1]
**Complexity**: Medium
**Risk**: Low
**Estimated Time**: 4-5 hours
**Status**: DEFERRED (Phase 1 completed research phase, Phase 5 addressed high-priority commands directly)

**Summary**: Apply same enforcement patterns from Phase 1 to /orchestrate's planning, implementation, and documentation phases. Add "EXECUTE NOW" markers for /plan, /implement, and summary creation. Add "MANDATORY VERIFICATION" for plan file, test status, and summary file. Add checkpoints after each phase plus final workflow completion checkpoint.

**Key Deliverables**:
- Planning phase: /plan invocation + verification
- Implementation phase: /implement invocation + test status extraction
- Documentation phase: Summary creation + verification
- Final workflow checkpoint with all metrics

For detailed implementation tasks and enforcement patterns, see:
**[Phase 2 Details](phase_2_orchestrate_other_phases.md)**

### Phase 2.5: Fix Priority Subagent Prompts [EXPANDED]
**Objective**: Strengthen 6 priority subagent prompts with execution enforcement patterns
**Dependencies**: [1]
**Complexity**: Medium
**Risk**: Low (agents are invoked by commands, not standalone)
**Estimated Time**: 8-10 hours
**Status**: DEFERRED (Command-level enforcement in Phase 5 proved sufficient for immediate needs)

**Priority Agents**: research-specialist, plan-architect, code-writer, spec-updater, implementation-researcher, debug-analyst

**Summary**: Apply execution enforcement to 6 priority subagent prompt files. Convert "I am" declarations to "YOU MUST" directives. Add "EXECUTE NOW" markers for file creation. Add "MANDATORY VERIFICATION" checkpoints. Strengthen sequential step enforcement. Eliminate passive voice and conditional language. Target: 100% file creation rate.

**Common Patterns Applied**:
- Role description: "I am..." → "**YOU MUST perform these exact steps:**"
- File creation: "Create files" → "**EXECUTE NOW - Create File** (ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENT)"
- Verification: "Verify..." → "**MANDATORY VERIFICATION**"
- Sequential steps: Numbered list → "**STEP N (REQUIRED BEFORE STEP N+1)**"
- Language: "should/may/can" → "MUST/WILL/SHALL"

**Key Deliverables**:
- All 6 agents use imperative language
- File creation with "EXECUTE NOW" markers
- Mandatory verification checkpoints
- Sequential step dependencies
- 100% file creation rate

For agent-specific transformations, before/after examples, and testing strategy, see:
**[Phase 2.5 Details](phase_2_5_subagent_prompts.md)**

### Phase 3: Create Command Audit Framework

**Dependencies**: [1]
**Complexity**: Medium
**Risk**: Low
**Estimated Time**: 3-4 hours
**Status**: COMPLETED
**Completion Date**: 2025-10-19

**Tasks**:
1. [x] Create audit checklist template
2. [x] Create audit script (.claude/lib/audit-execution-enforcement.sh)
3. [x] Create audit report template
4. [x] Document audit process
5. [ ] Add audit to CI/CD pipeline checks (deferred)

**Validation**:
- [x] Audit checklist covers all Standard 0 patterns
- [x] Audit script runs successfully
- [x] Audit process documented

### Phase 4: Audit All 20 Commands
**Objective**: Systematically audit every command for execution enforcement gaps
**Dependencies**: [3]
**Complexity**: Medium
**Risk**: Low
**Estimated Time**: 6-8 hours
**Status**: COMPLETED
**Completion Date**: 2025-10-19

**Tasks**:
1. [x] Run audit script on all commands
2. [x] Manually review and score each command
3. [x] Create audit YAML file for each command
4. [x] Categorize by severity and priority
5. [x] Audit /implement command (identified as high-risk: 562 lines, 9 agent invocations)
6. [x] Audit /plan command (identified as high-risk: 930 lines, 5 agent invocations)
7. [x] Audit /expand command (identified as medium-risk: 678 lines, parallel agents)
8. [x] Audit /debug command (identified as medium-risk: 564 lines, parallel hypotheses)
9. [x] Audit /document command
10. [x] Audit remaining 15 commands

- [x] Each command has audit file
- [x] Summary report complete
- [x] /implement, /plan, /expand prioritized based on research

### Phase 5: Fix High-Priority Commands [EXPANDED]
**Objective**: Apply execution enforcement to most critical commands beyond /orchestrate
**Dependencies**: [4]
**Complexity**: High
**Risk**: Medium
**Estimated Time**: 12-16 hours
**Actual Time**: ~8 hours (focused on highest-impact patterns)
**Status**: COMPLETED
**Completion Date**: 2025-10-19
**Final Score**: 85.4/100 average across 5 commands (exceeds 85+ target)

**Priority Commands**: /implement (9 agents), /plan (5 agents), /expand (auto-analysis), /debug (parallel investigation), /document (cross-references)

**Summary**: Apply execution enforcement to 5 high-priority commands identified through research. Each command delegates work to multiple agents and requires enforcement at agent invocation points, verification checkpoints, and fallback mechanisms. Focus on "THIS EXACT TEMPLATE" markers for agent invocations, "MANDATORY VERIFICATION" for outputs, and "CHECKPOINT REQUIREMENT" at phase boundaries.

**Command-Specific Deliverables**:
- **/implement**: 9 agent invocations strengthened, adaptive planning enforced, hierarchy updates verified, phase checkpoints added
- **/plan**: Step 0.5 research delegation enforced, parallel research mandatory, complexity pre-analysis required, plan file verified
- **/expand**: Auto-analysis mode enforced, complexity estimator mandatory, parallel expansion required, expanded files verified
- **/debug**: Parallel investigation enforced, debug-analyst template strengthened, report creation verified, investigation checkpointed
- **/document**: Documentation updates enforced, cross-references verified mandatory, update completion checkpointed

**Key Patterns**:
- Agent invocation: "THIS EXACT TEMPLATE (No modifications)"
- Critical operations: "EXECUTE NOW"
- Verification: "MANDATORY VERIFICATION"
- Checkpoints: "CHECKPOINT REQUIREMENT"
- Parallel execution: Single message, multiple Task calls

## Risk Assessment

### Risks
1. **Breaking Existing Workflows** - Medium risk, mitigated by testing and fallbacks
2. **Performance Overhead** - Low risk, <5% expected
3. **Command Complexity Increase** - Low risk, improved reliability offsets
4. **Incomplete Audit** - Medium risk, systematic checklist mitigates
5. **Agent Behavior Changes** - Low risk, fallbacks provide safety
6. **Subagent Compatibility** - Low risk, agents invoked by commands (not standalone)

### Mitigation Strategies
- Incremental implementation
- Comprehensive testing per phase
- Fallback safety nets
- Clear documentation
- Changes are additive/reversible
- Test subagents through command invocation (not standalone)

## Performance Metrics

### Before (Current State)
- File creation: Variable
- User experience: Inconsistent
- Context usage: Variable
- Debugging: Difficult
- Subagent compliance: ~60-80% (research estimate)

### After (Target State)
- File creation: 100% guaranteed
- User experience: Consistent
- Context usage: <30%
- Debugging: Easy (checkpoints)
- Overhead: <5%
- Subagent compliance: 100% (enforced)

### Success Metrics
- File Creation Rate: 100% (commands + subagents)
- Checkpoint Reporting: All major commands
- Context Reduction: >90%
- Audit Coverage: 20/20 commands + 6/25 priority agents
- High-Priority Fixes: 5 commands + 6 agents
- Subagent Enforcement: 6 priority agents strengthened

## Notes

### Why This Matters
**Root Cause**: Command files and subagent prompts are AI prompts, not code. Descriptive language is interpreted as guidance, not requirements.

**Impact Without Fix**: Unpredictable failures, inconsistent experience, difficult debugging, variable file creation rates.

**Impact With Fix**: 100% reliability, clear execution flow, predictable outcomes, guaranteed artifact creation.

### Implementation Philosophy
1. **Explicit Over Implicit** - State requirements explicitly in commands and agents
2. **Fallbacks Guarantee Outcomes** - Safety nets for reliability
3. **Checkpoints Provide Visibility** - Clear progress indicators
4. **Context Reduction via Metadata** - Enable complex workflows
5. **Enforcement Cascades** - Commands enforce agents, agents enforce operations

### Phase Dependencies
