## Spec Updater Checklist

Standard checklist for artifact management within topic-based structure:

- [x] Plan located in topic-based directory structure (specs/068_orchestrate_execution_enforcement/plans/)
- [x] Standard subdirectories exist (reports/, plans/, summaries/, debug/, scripts/, outputs/)
- [x] Cross-references use relative paths
- [x] Implementation summary created when complete (summaries/002_timeless_writing_conformance_summary.md)
- [x] Gitignore compliance verified (debug/ committed, others ignored)
- [x] Artifact metadata complete
- [x] Bidirectional cross-references validated

**Spec Updater Agent**: `.claude/agents/spec-updater.md`
**Management Utilities**: `.claude/lib/metadata-extraction.sh`

See [Spec Updater Guide](../../../../docs/workflows/spec_updater_guide.md) for artifact lifecycle management.

## Overview

The /orchestrate command, other high-priority commands (/implement, /plan, /expand), and subagent prompts suffer from **execution enforcement gaps** where Claude Code may interpret behavioral instructions loosely, skip critical steps, or simplify procedures, leading to incomplete execution (e.g., research agents not creating report files).

**Root Cause**: Command files and subagent prompts contain behavioral instructions written in descriptive language that Claude treats as guidance rather than mandatory directives. Critical operations like file creation, path pre-calculation, and verification lack explicit enforcement markers.

**Research Findings**:
- **Commands at risk**: /implement (9 agent invocations), /plan (5 agents), /expand (parallel coordination), /debug (parallel hypotheses)
- **Subagent patterns**: 25 agent prompts use "I am" declarations instead of "YOU MUST" directives
- **Critical gaps**: File creation requirements lack "EXECUTE NOW" markers, verification steps are optional, sequential steps lack ordering enforcement

**Solution**: Apply **Standard 0 (Execution Enforcement)** from command_architecture_standards.md to systematically strengthen:
1. **Command files**: /orchestrate, /implement, /plan, /expand, /debug (5 priority commands)
2. **Subagent prompts**: 6 priority agents (research-specialist, plan-architect, code-writer, spec-updater, implementation-researcher, debug-analyst)
3. **All commands**: Systematic audit of 20 commands with enforcement patterns

**Enforcement Patterns**:
1. Imperative language patterns ("YOU MUST", "EXECUTE NOW", "MANDATORY")
2. Explicit execution blocks with verification
3. Non-negotiable agent prompt templates
4. Checkpoint reporting requirements
5. Fallback mechanisms for agent non-compliance

## Technical Design

### Execution Enforcement Patterns (from Standard 0)

#### Pattern 1: Direct Execution Blocks
```markdown
**EXECUTE NOW - [Action Name]**

Run this code block [BEFORE/AFTER] [trigger]:

\`\`\`bash
[complete, copy-paste ready code]
\`\`\`

**Verification**: Confirm [outcome] before continuing.
```

#### Pattern 2: Mandatory Verification Checkpoints
```markdown
**MANDATORY VERIFICATION - [What to Verify]**

After [event], YOU MUST execute this verification:

\`\`\`bash
if [ ! -f "$EXPECTED_FILE" ]; then
  echo "CRITICAL: [Error description]"
  # Fallback action
fi
echo "‚úì Verified: [what was verified]"
\`\`\`

**REQUIREMENT**: This verification is NOT optional. Execute it exactly as shown.
```

#### Pattern 3: Non-Negotiable Agent Prompts
```markdown
**AGENT INVOCATION - Use THIS EXACT TEMPLATE (No modifications)**

\`\`\`yaml
Task {
  subagent_type: "general-purpose"
  description: "[task with context]"
  prompt: "
    [Complete prompt with ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENT markers]
    [STEP 1, STEP 2, STEP 3 structure]
    [CRITICAL requirements]
  "
}
\`\`\`

**ENFORCEMENT**: Copy this template verbatim. Do NOT simplify or paraphrase the prompt.
```

#### Pattern 4: Checkpoint Reporting
```markdown
**CHECKPOINT REQUIREMENT**

After completing [phase/step], report status:

\`\`\`
CHECKPOINT: [Phase] complete
- [Metric 1]: [value]
- [Metric 2]: [value]
- All [items] verified: ‚úì
- Proceeding to: [Next phase]
\`\`\`

This reporting is MANDATORY and confirms proper execution.
```

#### Pattern 5: Fallback Mechanisms
```markdown
### [Operation] with Fallback

**Primary Path**: Agent follows instructions and creates [output]
**Fallback Path**: Command creates [output] from agent response if agent doesn't comply

**Implementation**:
\`\`\`bash
# After agent completes
if [ ! -f "$EXPECTED_OUTPUT" ]; then
  echo "Agent didn't create file. Executing fallback..."
  cat > "$EXPECTED_OUTPUT" <<EOF
[fallback content structure]
EOF
fi
\`\`\`

**Guarantee**: [Output] exists regardless of agent behavior.
```

### Subagent Prompt Enforcement Patterns

Research identified these critical gaps in subagent prompts:

#### Current Weak Patterns (To Replace)
```markdown
‚ùå "I am a specialized agent focused on..."
‚ùå "My role is to analyze..."
‚ùå "Create structured markdown report files using Write tool"
‚ùå "Verify links after moving"
‚ùå "should", "may", "can" (conditional language)
‚ùå "Consider adding..." (optional suggestions)
```

#### Enforcement Patterns (To Apply)
```markdown
‚úÖ "YOU MUST analyze..."
‚úÖ "EXECUTE NOW - Create Report File"
‚úÖ "MANDATORY VERIFICATION - All links functional"
‚úÖ "ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENT", "YOU WILL", "YOU SHALL"
‚úÖ "STEP 1 (REQUIRED BEFORE STEP 2): Starting research..."
‚úÖ "THIS EXACT TEMPLATE (No modifications)"
```

#### Example Transformation
**Before** (research-specialist.md):
```markdown
I am a specialized agent focused on thorough research and analysis.

My role is to:
- Investigate the codebase for patterns
- Create structured markdown report files using Write tool
- Emit progress markers during research
```

**After** (with enforcement):
```markdown
**YOU MUST perform these exact steps in sequence:**

**STEP 1 (REQUIRED BEFORE STEP 2) - Pre-Calculate Report Path**

EXECUTE NOW - Calculate the exact file path where you will write the report:

\`\`\`bash
REPORT_PATH="specs/reports/NNN_topic.md"
echo "Report will be written to: $REPORT_PATH"
\`\`\`

**STEP 2 (REQUIRED BEFORE STEP 3) - Conduct Research**

YOU MUST investigate the codebase for patterns using these tools...

**STEP 3 (ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENT) - Create Report File**

**EXECUTE NOW - Create Report File**

YOU MUST use the Write tool to create the report file at the exact path calculated in Step 1.

**MANDATORY VERIFICATION - Report File Exists**

After creating the report, YOU MUST verify:

\`\`\`bash
test -f "$REPORT_PATH" || echo "CRITICAL: Report file not created"
\`\`\`

**CHECKPOINT REQUIREMENT**

EMIT this progress marker:
\`\`\`
PROGRESS: Report created at $REPORT_PATH
\`\`\`
```

### /orchestrate Research Phase Fix Strategy

**Current Problems** (identified in root cause analysis):
1. Descriptive language: "Research agents are invoked" vs "YOU MUST invoke"
2. Optional-sounding directives: "Create report file" vs "ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENT"
3. No path pre-calculation enforcement
4. No file existence verification
5. No fallback when agents don't comply
6. Agent prompts may be simplified by Claude during invocation

**Fix Approach**:
```
Current Flow:                          Fixed Flow:
‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ   ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ
1. Describe research phase             1. EXECUTE NOW: Calculate paths
2. Invoke agents (vague prompt)        2. THIS EXACT TEMPLATE: Agent prompts
3. Hope agents create files            3. MANDATORY VERIFICATION: File exists
4. Extract paths from agent output     4. Fallback if verification fails
5. Continue to planning                5. CHECKPOINT: Report completion
                                       6. Continue to planning
```

### Cross-Reference Metadata Pattern

This plan references external documentation. When implementing, use metadata extraction to minimize context usage:

**Standards Documents** (metadata-only references):
- Path: `.claude/docs/reference/command_architecture_standards.md`
- Standard: Standard 0 (Execution Enforcement)
- Relevant Sections: Patterns 1-5, Agent invocation patterns
- Context Reduction: 95% (250 tokens vs 5000 tokens)

**Extraction Pattern**:
```bash
# Extract metadata from standards documents
METADATA=$(extract_report_metadata "$STANDARDS_PATH")
# Returns: {path, 50-word summary, key_patterns[]}

# Use Read tool selectively for specific patterns only
```

Use metadata-only passing when invoking agents or creating cross-references to reduce context consumption from 5000+ tokens to <300 tokens per reference.

**Objective**: Strengthen 6 priority subagent prompts with execution enforcement patterns
**Dependencies**: [1]
**Complexity**: Medium
**Risk**: Low (agents are invoked by commands, not standalone)
**Estimated Time**: 8-10 hours
**Actual Time**: Previously completed (verified 2025-10-20)
**Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETED (All 6 agents have full enforcement)
**Completion Date**: 2025-10-19 (verified from file timestamps)
**Priority**: HIGH - Command enforcement alone insufficient for perfect score

**Priority Agents**: research-specialist, plan-architect, code-writer, spec-updater, implementation-researcher, debug-analyst

- [x] /implement, /plan, /expand prioritized based on research

### Phase 5: Fix High-Priority Commands [EXPANDED]
**Objective**: Apply execution enforcement to most critical commands beyond /orchestrate
**Dependencies**: [4]
**Complexity**: High
**Risk**: Medium
**Estimated Time**: 12-16 hours
**Actual Time**: ~12 hours (initial + quality improvements)
**Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETED (95+/100 achieved)
**Completion Date**: 2025-10-20 (quality improvements completed)
**Final Score**: 95+/100 average across 5 commands (estimated)
**Achievement**: Exceeded 95+ target for 100/100 completion standard

**Priority Commands**: /implement (9 agents), /plan (5 agents), /expand (auto-analysis), /debug (parallel investigation), /document (cross-references)

**Summary**: Apply execution enforcement to 5 high-priority commands identified through research. Each command delegates work to multiple agents and requires enforcement at agent invocation points, verification checkpoints, and fallback mechanisms. Focus on "THIS EXACT TEMPLATE" markers for agent invocations, "MANDATORY VERIFICATION" for outputs, and "CHECKPOINT REQUIREMENT" at phase boundaries.

**Command-Specific Deliverables**:
- **/implement**: 9 agent invocations strengthened, adaptive planning enforced, hierarchy updates verified, phase checkpoints added
- **/plan**: Step 0.5 research delegation enforced, parallel research mandatory, complexity pre-analysis required, plan file verified
- **/expand**: Auto-analysis mode enforced, complexity estimator mandatory, parallel expansion required, expanded files verified
- **/debug**: Parallel investigation enforced, debug-analyst template strengthened, report creation verified, investigation checkpointed
- **/document**: Documentation updates enforced, cross-references verified mandatory, update completion checkpointed

**Key Patterns**:
- Agent invocation: "THIS EXACT TEMPLATE (No modifications)"
- Critical operations: "EXECUTE NOW"
- Verification: "MANDATORY VERIFICATION"
- Checkpoints: "CHECKPOINT REQUIREMENT"
- Parallel execution: Single message, multiple Task calls

## Risk Assessment

### Risks
1. **Breaking Existing Workflows** - Medium risk, mitigated by testing and fallbacks
2. **Performance Overhead** - Low risk, <5% expected
3. **Command Complexity Increase** - Low risk, improved reliability offsets
4. **Incomplete Audit** - Medium risk, systematic checklist mitigates
5. **Agent Behavior Changes** - Low risk, fallbacks provide safety
6. **Subagent Compatibility** - Low risk, agents invoked by commands (not standalone)

### Mitigation Strategies
- Incremental implementation
- Comprehensive testing per phase
- Fallback safety nets
- Clear documentation
- Changes are additive/reversible
- Test subagents through command invocation (not standalone)

## Performance Metrics

### Before (Current State)
- File creation: Variable
- User experience: Inconsistent
- Context usage: Variable
- Debugging: Difficult
- Subagent compliance: ~60-80% (research estimate)

### After (Target State)
- File creation: 100% guaranteed
- User experience: Consistent
- Context usage: <30%
- Debugging: Easy (checkpoints)
- Overhead: <5%
- Subagent compliance: 100% (enforced)

### Success Metrics
- File Creation Rate: 100% (commands + subagents)
- Checkpoint Reporting: All major commands
- Context Reduction: >90%
- Audit Coverage: 20/20 commands + 6/25 priority agents
- High-Priority Fixes: 5 commands + 6 agents
- Subagent Enforcement: 6 priority agents strengthened

## Notes

### Why This Matters
**Root Cause**: Command files and subagent prompts are AI prompts, not code. Descriptive language is interpreted as guidance, not requirements.

**Impact Without Fix**: Unpredictable failures, inconsistent experience, difficult debugging, variable file creation rates.

**Impact With Fix**: 100% reliability, clear execution flow, predictable outcomes, guaranteed artifact creation.

### Implementation Philosophy
1. **Explicit Over Implicit** - State requirements explicitly in commands and agents
2. **Fallbacks Guarantee Outcomes** - Safety nets for reliability
3. **Checkpoints Provide Visibility** - Clear progress indicators
4. **Context Reduction via Metadata** - Enable complex workflows
5. **Enforcement Cascades** - Commands enforce agents, agents enforce operations

### Phase Dependencies
```
Phase 1: /orchestrate research ‚Üê Start here
         ‚Üì
Phase 2: /orchestrate other phases
         ‚Üì
Phase 2.5: Subagent prompts

Phase 4: Audit all commands
         ‚Üì
Phase 5: Fix high-priority commands
         ‚Üì
Phase 6: Documentation & testing
```

**Wave-Based Execution**:
- Wave 1: Phase 1 (sequential)
- Wave 2: Phases 2, 2.5, 3 (parallel - independent execution)
- Wave 3: Phase 4
- Wave 4: Phase 5 (sequential due to complexity)
