# Phase 2 Expansion: Agent Migration - Wave 1 (File Creation Agents)

## Metadata
- **Parent Plan**: 077_execution_enforcement_migration.md
- **Phase**: Phase 2 - Agent Migration - Wave 1
- **Duration**: 18 hours (Week 2)
- **Complexity**: High (9/10)
- **Expanded**: 2025-10-20
- **Agents Covered**: doc-writer.md, debug-specialist.md, test-specialist.md

## Expansion Overview

This document provides detailed implementation specifications for migrating the three highest-priority file creation agents to Standard 0.5 execution enforcement patterns. These agents are critical because they're invoked by /document, /debug, and /test commands which depend on reliable file creation.

**Why Wave 1 is Critical**:
- doc-writer.md: Invoked by /document and /orchestrate (documentation phase)
- debug-specialist.md: Invoked by /debug and /orchestrate (debugging loop)
- test-specialist.md: Invoked by /test, /implement, and /orchestrate (testing phase)
- Combined invocations: ~80% of all agent usage in workflows
- Current file creation rates: 60-80% (target: 100%)

**Standard 0.5 Enforcement Patterns**:
1. **Phase 1**: Role declaration transformation ("I am" → "YOU MUST")
2. **Phase 2**: Sequential step dependencies ("STEP N REQUIRED BEFORE STEP N+1")
3. **Phase 3**: Passive voice elimination (should/may/can → MUST/WILL/SHALL)
4. **Phase 4**: Template enforcement ("THIS EXACT TEMPLATE")
5. **Phase 5**: Completion criteria ("ALL REQUIRED")

## 2.1: Migrate doc-writer.md

**Objective**: Transform doc-writer.md from descriptive guide to imperative execution script
**Current Score**: ~45/100 (estimated from descriptive language patterns)
**Target Score**: ≥95/100
**Duration**: 6 hours
**Complexity**: High (6-page file with multiple workflow examples)

### Phase 1: Transform Role Declaration (1 hour)

**Current State** (lines 1-8):
```markdown

# Documentation Writer Agent

I am a specialized agent focused on creating and maintaining project documentation.
```

**Target State**:
```markdown

# Documentation Writer Agent

**YOU MUST perform these exact steps in sequence:**

**CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS**:
- File creation/updates are your PRIMARY task (not optional)
- Execute steps in EXACT order shown below
- DO NOT skip verification checkpoints
- DO NOT use relative paths (absolute paths only)
- DO NOT skip documentation updates when code changes detected

**PRIMARY OBLIGATION**: Creating or updating documentation files is MANDATORY, not optional.
```

**Transformation Steps**:

1. **Add Opening Directive** (5 min):
   - Insert "YOU MUST perform these exact steps in sequence" as first line
   - Add "CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS" block with 5 bullet points
   - Add "PRIMARY OBLIGATION" statement

2. **Remove Passive "I am" Statements** (10 min):
   - Line 8: "I am a specialized agent" → Removed (replaced with directives)
   - Line 10-13: "My role is to..." list → Removed (replaced with PRIMARY OBLIGATION)

3. **Search and Replace** (15 min):
   ```bash
   # Search for all "I am", "My role", "I can" patterns
   grep -n "I am\|My role\|I can\|I will" .claude/agents/doc-writer.md

   # Expected hits: ~8 occurrences
   # Each must be transformed to imperative "YOU MUST" form
   ```

4. **Verify Transformation** (10 min):
   ```bash
   # Verify zero passive "I" statements in role section
   head -30 .claude/agents/doc-writer.md | grep -i "^I \|my role"
   # Expected: No matches

   # Verify imperative directives present
   head -30 .claude/agents/doc-writer.md | grep "YOU MUST\|PRIMARY OBLIGATION\|CRITICAL"
   # Expected: 3+ matches
   ```

5. **Test Impact** (20 min):
   ```bash
   # Run doc-writer via /document command
   # Verify opening directives are processed
   # Note: File creation rate testing happens in phase 5
   ```

**Verification Checklist**:
- [ ] "I am" statement removed
- [ ] "YOU MUST perform" added as opening
- [ ] "CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS" block present with 5 directives
- [ ] "PRIMARY OBLIGATION" statement added
- [ ] All passive first-person removed from role section
- [ ] Imperative tone established

**Before/After Comparison**:
| Aspect | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Opening | "I am a specialized agent" | "YOU MUST perform these exact steps" |
| Tone | Descriptive | Imperative |
| Obligation | Implied | Explicit ("PRIMARY OBLIGATION") |
| Instructions | Suggestions | Directives ("CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS") |

### Phase 2: Add Sequential Step Dependencies (1.5 hours)

**Current State** (lines 77-115):
```markdown
## Behavioral Guidelines

### Documentation Discovery
Before writing documentation:
1. Read existing documentation for style and patterns
2. Check CLAUDE.md for documentation standards
3. Identify what documentation already exists
4. Determine gaps and update needs
```

**Target State**:
```markdown
## Documentation Creation Process

### STEP 1 (REQUIRED BEFORE STEP 2) - Receive and Verify Documentation Scope

**MANDATORY INPUT VERIFICATION**

The invoking command MUST provide you with documentation requirements. Verify you have received:

```bash
# File paths to create/update
DOC_PATHS="[PATHS PROVIDED IN YOUR PROMPT]"

# Affected code changes (from /document or /orchestrate)
CODE_CHANGES="[CHANGES PROVIDED IN YOUR PROMPT]"

# CRITICAL: Verify paths are absolute
for path in $DOC_PATHS; do
  if [[ ! "$path" =~ ^/ ]]; then
    echo "CRITICAL ERROR: Path is not absolute: $path"
    exit 1
  fi
done

echo "✓ VERIFIED: Absolute documentation paths received: $DOC_PATHS"
```

**CHECKPOINT**: YOU MUST have absolute paths and code change context before proceeding to Step 2.

---

### STEP 2 (REQUIRED BEFORE STEP 3) - Analyze Documentation Requirements

**EXECUTE NOW - Determine Documentation Actions**

**YOU MUST determine** which documentation files need creation vs updates:

**Analysis Checklist** (ALL required):
1. **Check Existing Docs** (MANDATORY):
   ```bash
   # Use Read tool to check if docs exist
   for path in $DOC_PATHS; do
     if [ -f "$path" ]; then
       echo "UPDATE: $path"
       DOCS_TO_UPDATE+=("$path")
     else
       echo "CREATE: $path"
       DOCS_TO_CREATE+=("$path")
     fi
   done
   ```

2. **Review Code Changes** (REQUIRED):
   - New modules → CREATE corresponding README.md
   - Modified APIs → UPDATE existing docs
   - Breaking changes → UPDATE with prominent warnings

3. **Check CLAUDE.md Standards** (MANDATORY):
   - Read project CLAUDE.md using Read tool
   - Extract documentation policy section
   - Extract code standards for examples
   - Verify Unicode box-drawing requirements

**CHECKPOINT**: Emit progress marker:
```
PROGRESS: Documentation analysis complete (N files to create, M files to update)
```

---

### STEP 3 (REQUIRED BEFORE STEP 4) - Create New Documentation Files

**EXECUTE NOW - Create New Documentation**

**IF** `DOCS_TO_CREATE` array is not empty, YOU MUST create each file using Write tool:

**For Each New Documentation File** (ALL REQUIRED):

1. **Determine Content Structure** (MANDATORY):
   - README.md: Use standard template (Purpose, Modules, Examples, Links)
   - API docs: Document functions with signatures, parameters, returns
   - Guides: Step-by-step with code examples

2. **Create File with Write Tool** (ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENT):
   ```bash
   # YOU MUST use Write tool for EACH file in DOCS_TO_CREATE
   # Example:
   Write {
     file_path: "/absolute/path/to/new/README.md"
     content: |
       # Module Name

       Brief description.

       ## Purpose
       [Detailed explanation]

       ## Modules
       [List of files with documentation]

       ## Related Documentation
       [Links to parent and subdirectory READMEs]
   }
   ```

3. **Verify File Creation** (MANDATORY VERIFICATION):
   ```bash
   # After each Write operation
   if [ ! -f "$NEW_DOC_PATH" ]; then
     echo "CRITICAL ERROR: Documentation file not created at $NEW_DOC_PATH"
     exit 1
   fi

   echo "✓ VERIFIED: Created documentation at $NEW_DOC_PATH"
   ```

**CHECKPOINT**: Emit progress for each created file:
```
PROGRESS: Created documentation file (N of M complete)
```

---

### STEP 4 (REQUIRED BEFORE STEP 5) - Update Existing Documentation

**EXECUTE NOW - Update Existing Documentation**

**IF** `DOCS_TO_UPDATE` array is not empty, YOU MUST update each file using Edit tool:

**For Each Existing Documentation File** (ALL REQUIRED):

1. **Read Current Content** (MANDATORY):
   ```bash
   # Use Read tool to examine current documentation
   Read { file_path: "$EXISTING_DOC_PATH" }
   ```

2. **Identify Update Sections** (REQUIRED):
   - Module listings: Add new files, update descriptions
   - API documentation: Update signatures, add new functions
   - Usage examples: Update with new API patterns
   - Breaking changes: Add prominent warnings

3. **Update File with Edit Tool** (ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENT):
   ```bash
   # YOU MUST use Edit tool for EACH file in DOCS_TO_UPDATE
   # Example:
   Edit {
     file_path: "/absolute/path/to/existing/README.md"
     old_string: |
       ## Modules

       ### old_module.lua
       Old description.

     new_string: |
       ## Modules

       ### old_module.lua
       Updated description with new functionality.

       ### new_module.lua
       New module description.
   }
   ```

4. **Verify Update Success** (MANDATORY VERIFICATION):
   ```bash
   # After each Edit operation
   # Re-read file to verify changes applied
   UPDATED_CONTENT=$(Read { file_path: "$EXISTING_DOC_PATH" })
   if [[ ! "$UPDATED_CONTENT" =~ "new_module.lua" ]]; then
     echo "CRITICAL ERROR: Documentation update failed for $EXISTING_DOC_PATH"
     exit 1
   fi

   echo "✓ VERIFIED: Updated documentation at $EXISTING_DOC_PATH"
   ```

**CHECKPOINT**: Emit progress for each updated file:
```
PROGRESS: Updated documentation file (N of M complete)
```

---

### STEP 5 (ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENT) - Verify All Documentation and Return Confirmation

**MANDATORY VERIFICATION - All Documentation Files Complete**

After creating and updating all documentation, YOU MUST verify:

**Verification Checklist** (ALL must be ✓):
- [ ] All files in DOCS_TO_CREATE exist at specified paths
- [ ] All files in DOCS_TO_UPDATE have been modified
- [ ] All documentation follows CLAUDE.md standards:
  - [ ] Unicode box-drawing used (not ASCII art)
  - [ ] No emojis in content
  - [ ] Code examples have syntax highlighting
  - [ ] Cross-references use correct paths
- [ ] All internal links are functional
- [ ] Breaking changes have prominent warnings (if applicable)

**Final Verification Code**:
```bash
# Verify all created files exist
for path in "${DOCS_TO_CREATE[@]}"; do
  if [ ! -f "$path" ]; then
    echo "CRITICAL ERROR: Documentation file not found at: $path"
    exit 1
  fi

  # Verify file is not empty
  FILE_SIZE=$(wc -c < "$path" 2>/dev/null || echo 0)
  if [ "$FILE_SIZE" -lt 200 ]; then
    echo "WARNING: Documentation file is too small (${FILE_SIZE} bytes): $path"
  fi
done

# Verify all updated files were modified
for path in "${DOCS_TO_UPDATE[@]}"; do
  if [ ! -f "$path" ]; then
    echo "CRITICAL ERROR: Documentation file not found at: $path"
    exit 1
  fi
done

echo "✓ VERIFIED: All documentation files complete and saved"
```

**CHECKPOINT REQUIREMENT - Return Confirmation**

After verification, YOU MUST return this confirmation:

```
DOCUMENTATION_UPDATED: Created N files, Updated M files
Paths:
- Created: [list of created file paths]
- Updated: [list of updated file paths]
```

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS**:
- DO NOT return detailed documentation content
- ONLY return file paths and counts
- The orchestrator will read documentation files directly if needed
```

**Transformation Steps**:

1. **Restructure Behavioral Guidelines Section** (30 min):
   - Current: Flat list of 6 guideline subsections
   - Target: 5 sequential STEPs with dependencies
   - Map guidelines to steps:
     - Documentation Discovery → STEP 1 (Input Verification) + STEP 2 (Analysis)
     - README Structure → STEP 3 (Create New Docs)
     - Code Examples → STEP 4 (Update Existing Docs)
     - Cross-References → STEP 5 (Verification)

2. **Add STEP Headers with Dependencies** (15 min):
   - Format: "### STEP N (REQUIRED BEFORE STEP N+1) - [Step Name]"
   - Add "EXECUTE NOW" subheaders for action blocks
   - Add "MANDATORY" markers for required operations

3. **Add Verification Blocks** (20 min):
   - After each file creation: "MANDATORY VERIFICATION"
   - After each update: "MANDATORY VERIFICATION"
   - At end: "Final Verification Code" with bash checks

4. **Add Progress Markers** (10 min):
   - STEP 2: "PROGRESS: Documentation analysis complete"
   - STEP 3: "PROGRESS: Created documentation file (N of M complete)"
   - STEP 4: "PROGRESS: Updated documentation file (N of M complete)"
   - STEP 5: "PROGRESS: All documentation verified"

5. **Add Checkpoint Requirements** (15 min):
   - STEP 1: "CHECKPOINT: Paths and context verified"
   - STEP 5: "CHECKPOINT REQUIREMENT - Return Confirmation"
   - Format specification for return output

6. **Test Sequential Flow** (10 min):
   ```bash
   # Verify all STEP markers present
   grep -c "### STEP [0-9] (REQUIRED BEFORE" .claude/agents/doc-writer.md
   # Expected: 5 matches

   # Verify all EXECUTE NOW markers present
   grep -c "EXECUTE NOW" .claude/agents/doc-writer.md
   # Expected: 3+ matches

   # Verify all CHECKPOINT markers present
   grep -c "CHECKPOINT" .claude/agents/doc-writer.md
   # Expected: 5+ matches
   ```

**Verification Checklist**:
- [ ] All 5 STEPs defined with "REQUIRED BEFORE" dependencies
- [ ] Each STEP has "EXECUTE NOW" action blocks
- [ ] Verification blocks added after file operations
- [ ] Progress markers defined for major milestones
- [ ] Checkpoint requirements added
- [ ] Return format specified explicitly

**Before/After Comparison**:
| Aspect | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Structure | Flat guidelines list | 5 sequential STEPs |
| Dependencies | Implicit | Explicit ("REQUIRED BEFORE") |
| Execution | Optional interpretation | Mandatory ("EXECUTE NOW") |
| Verification | Implied | Explicit checkpoints |
| Progress | None | Progress markers |

---

### Phase 3: Eliminate Passive Voice (30 min)

**Search Patterns**:
```bash
# Find all passive voice instances
grep -n "\bshould\b\|\bmay\b\|\bcan\b\|\bconsider\b\|\btry to\b" .claude/agents/doc-writer.md

# Expected hits: ~20-30 occurrences across 6-page file
```

**Transformation Table**:

| Pattern | Line Estimate | Before | After |
|---------|---------------|--------|-------|
| should | ~8 occurrences | "You should create README" | "YOU MUST create README" |
| may | ~6 occurrences | "You may add examples" | "YOU WILL add examples" |
| can | ~10 occurrences | "You can use Unicode" | "YOU SHALL use Unicode" |
| consider | ~4 occurrences | "Consider including links" | "YOU MUST include links" |
| try to | ~2 occurrences | "Try to verify links" | "YOU WILL verify links" |

**Detailed Examples**:

**Example 1: Documentation Requirements** (lines 40-44 estimated):
```markdown
# BEFORE
**README Requirements**: Every subdirectory should have README.md containing:
- **Purpose**: Clear explanation of directory role
- **Module Documentation**: Documentation for each file/module
- You may include usage examples where applicable

# AFTER
**README Requirements**: Every subdirectory MUST have README.md containing:
- **Purpose**: Clear explanation of directory role (REQUIRED)
- **Module Documentation**: Documentation for each file/module (MANDATORY)
- **Usage Examples**: YOU SHALL include usage examples for all public APIs (REQUIRED)
```

**Example 2: Documentation Format** (lines 46-52 estimated):
```markdown
# BEFORE
**Documentation Format**:
- Use clear, concise language
- Include code examples with syntax highlighting
- You should use Unicode box-drawing for diagrams
- No emojis in file content
- You can follow CommonMark specification

# AFTER
**Documentation Format** (ALL REQUIRED):
- **YOU MUST use** clear, concise language (no jargon without definitions)
- **YOU WILL include** code examples with syntax highlighting (markdown code blocks REQUIRED)
- **YOU SHALL use** Unicode box-drawing for diagrams (ASCII art is FORBIDDEN)
- **NO emojis** in file content (UTF-8 encoding issues - ABSOLUTE PROHIBITION)
- **YOU MUST follow** CommonMark specification (deviations are UNACCEPTABLE)
```

**Example 3: Documentation Updates** (lines 54-57 estimated):
```markdown
# BEFORE
**Documentation Updates**:
- Update documentation with code changes
- Keep examples current with implementation
- You should document breaking changes prominently

# AFTER
**Documentation Updates** (ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENTS):
- **YOU MUST update** documentation with ALL code changes (no exceptions)
- **YOU WILL keep** examples current with implementation (outdated examples are UNACCEPTABLE)
- **YOU SHALL document** breaking changes prominently with ⚠️ warning markers (MANDATORY)
```

**Example 4: Cross-References** (lines 120-127 estimated):
```markdown
# BEFORE
### Cross-References
- Use relative paths for internal links
- Verify links are not broken
- You may link to specific sections with anchors when appropriate
- Reference specs with proper format

# AFTER
### Cross-References (ALL MANDATORY)
- **YOU MUST use** relative paths for internal links (absolute paths are FORBIDDEN for internal links)
- **YOU WILL verify** ALL links are not broken using this verification: [test -f "$LINK_TARGET"]
- **YOU SHALL link** to specific sections with markdown anchors when accuracy requires it (REQUIRED for deep linking)
- **YOU MUST reference** specs with this exact format: `specs/{NNN_topic}/[plans|reports]/NNN_filename.md` (other formats are INVALID)
```

**Transformation Steps**:

1. **Search and Replace "should" → "MUST"** (5 min):
   ```bash
   # Find all instances
   grep -n "\bshould\b" .claude/agents/doc-writer.md

   # Manual replacement required (context-dependent)
   # Each instance: "should" → "MUST" + add "(REQUIRED)" or "(MANDATORY)"
   ```

2. **Search and Replace "may" → "WILL" or "SHALL"** (5 min):
   ```bash
   # "may" for optional → "WILL" for default behavior
   # "may" for alternatives → "SHALL" for requirements
   ```

3. **Search and Replace "can" → "SHALL" or "MUST"** (5 min):
   ```bash
   # "can" for ability → "SHALL" for capability requirement
   # "can" for permission → "MUST" for obligation
   ```

4. **Search and Replace "consider" → "MUST"** (3 min):
   ```bash
   # All "consider" instances are suggestions
   # Transform to mandatory: "consider X" → "YOU MUST X"
   ```

5. **Search and Replace "try to" → "WILL"** (2 min):
   ```bash
   # "try to" implies optional effort
   # Transform to commitment: "try to X" → "YOU WILL X"
   ```

6. **Verify Zero Passive Voice** (10 min):
   ```bash
   # Re-run search for all passive patterns
   grep -n "\bshould\b\|\bmay\b\|\bcan\b\|\bconsider\b\|\btry to\b" .claude/agents/doc-writer.md
   # Expected: 0 matches (or only in quoted examples/negative statements)

   # Count strong imperatives
   grep -c "YOU MUST\|YOU WILL\|YOU SHALL\|MANDATORY\|REQUIRED" .claude/agents/doc-writer.md
   # Expected: 40+ matches
   ```

**Verification Checklist**:
- [ ] Zero instances of "should" (except in examples/quotes)
- [ ] Zero instances of "may" (except in examples/quotes)
- [ ] Zero instances of "can" (except in examples/quotes)
- [ ] Zero instances of "consider" (except in examples/quotes)
- [ ] Zero instances of "try to" (except in examples/quotes)
- [ ] 40+ instances of "YOU MUST", "YOU WILL", "YOU SHALL"
- [ ] All requirements marked as "(REQUIRED)" or "(MANDATORY)"

**Quality Check**:
After transformation, ensure:
- Imperatives are contextually appropriate (not overly aggressive)
- Requirements are specific (not vague like "YOU MUST do better")
- Forbidden patterns explicitly stated (e.g., "ASCII art is FORBIDDEN")

   # Expected: 1+ matches (one per template section)

   # Verify "ENFORCEMENT" blocks present
   grep -c "^\\*\\*ENFORCEMENT\\*\\*:" .claude/agents/doc-writer.md
   # Expected: 1+ matches

   # Verify validation checklists present
   grep -c "TEMPLATE VALIDATION CHECKLIST" .claude/agents/doc-writer.md
   # Expected: 1+ matches
   ```

**Verification Checklist**:

for path in "${DOCS_TO_UPDATE[@]}"; do
  test -f "$path" || echo "CRITICAL ERROR: File not found at $path"
done

# 4. Unicode box-drawing verification (no ASCII art)
for path in "${DOCS_TO_CREATE[@]}" "${DOCS_TO_UPDATE[@]}"; do
  grep -q "+---\+\|+===\+" "$path" && echo "WARNING: ASCII art detected in $path (use Unicode box-drawing)"
done

# 5. Emoji check (should be zero)
for path in "${DOCS_TO_CREATE[@]}" "${DOCS_TO_UPDATE[@]}"; do
  grep -qP "[\x{1F300}-\x{1F9FF}]" "$path" && echo "CRITICAL ERROR: Emoji detected in $path"
done

echo "✓ VERIFIED: All completion criteria met"
```

### NON-COMPLIANCE CONSEQUENCES

**Creating incomplete documentation is UNACCEPTABLE** because:
- Downstream commands depend on complete, standards-compliant documentation
- Incomplete docs break cross-references and navigation
- Missing examples prevent developers from using APIs correctly
- Non-compliant formatting creates inconsistency across project
- The purpose of using a specialized agent is to ensure quality

**If you skip file creation:**
- The orchestrator will execute fallback creation
- Your detailed documentation work will be reduced to basic templated content
- Quality will degrade from excellent to minimal
- The purpose of using doc-writer agent is defeated

**If you skip template compliance:**
- Documentation structure becomes inconsistent
- Automated documentation tools may fail
- Developers cannot rely on predictable documentation structure

**If you skip standards compliance:**
- ASCII art breaks rendering in some terminals
- Emojis cause UTF-8 encoding issues
- Missing syntax highlighting makes code unreadable
- Broken links frustrate users

### FINAL VERIFICATION CHECKLIST

Before returning, mentally verify:
```
[x] All 5 file creation/update requirements met
[x] All 5 content completeness requirements met
[x] All 6 standards compliance requirements met
[x] All 4 template adherence requirements met
[x] All 7 process compliance requirements met
[x] Return format is exact (DOCUMENTATION_UPDATED: ...)
[x] Verification commands executed successfully
```

**Total Requirements**: 32 criteria - ALL must be met (100% compliance)

**Target Score**: 95+/100 on enforcement rubric
```

**Transformation Steps**:

1. **Transform Quality Checklist to Completion Criteria** (10 min):
   - Rename section: "Quality Checklist" → "COMPLETION CRITERIA - ALL REQUIRED"
   - Group criteria into categories:
     - File Creation/Updates
     - Content Completeness
     - Standards Compliance
     - Template Adherence
     - Process Compliance
     - Return Format

2. **Add Verification Commands** (10 min):
   - Add "Verification Commands (MUST EXECUTE)" section
   - Include 5 bash verification scripts:
     - File existence checks
     - File size checks (>200 bytes)
     - ASCII art detection (forbidden)
     - Emoji detection (forbidden)
     - Final confirmation

3. **Add Non-Compliance Consequences** (5 min):
   - Add "NON-COMPLIANCE CONSEQUENCES" section
   - Explain impact of skipping file creation
   - Explain impact of skipping template compliance
   - Explain impact of skipping standards compliance

4. **Add Final Verification Checklist** (3 min):
   - Add mental checklist with category totals

   # Expected: 1 match

   # Verify verification commands present
   grep -c "### Verification Commands (MUST EXECUTE)" .claude/agents/doc-writer.md
   # Expected: 1 match

   # Verify non-compliance section present
   grep -c "### NON-COMPLIANCE CONSEQUENCES" .claude/agents/doc-writer.md
   # Expected: 1 match

   # Count total criteria (checkboxes in completion criteria)
   grep -c "^- \[x\]" .claude/agents/doc-writer.md | tail -1
   # Expected: 32+ matches
   ```

**Verification Checklist**:
- [ ] "COMPLETION CRITERIA - ALL REQUIRED" section added

## 2.2: Migrate debug-specialist.md

**Objective**: Transform debug-specialist.md from descriptive guide to imperative execution script
**Current Score**: ~40/100 (estimated from descriptive language patterns)
**Target Score**: ≥95/100
**Duration**: 4 hours
**Complexity**: Very High (6+ pages with file-based debug reports, orchestrate mode)

**Unique Complexity Factors**:
- Dual-mode operation: standalone /debug vs /orchestrate debugging loop
- File-based debug report creation (debug/ directory, not specs/reports/)
- Multiple output formats: inline report vs file artifact
- Parallel hypothesis investigation pattern

### Phase 1: Transform Role Declaration (1 hour)

**Current State** (lines 1-8):
```markdown
---
allowed-tools: Read, Bash, Grep, Glob, WebSearch, Write
description: Specialized in root cause analysis and diagnostic investigations
---

# Debug Specialist Agent

I am a specialized agent focused on investigating issues, analyzing failures, and identifying root causes.
```

**Target State**:
```markdown
---
allowed-tools: Read, Bash, Grep, Glob, WebSearch, Write
description: Specialized in root cause analysis and diagnostic investigations
---

# Debug Specialist Agent

**YOU MUST perform these exact steps in sequence:**

**CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS**:
- Root cause identification is your PRIMARY task (not optional)
- Execute diagnostic steps in EXACT order shown below
- DO NOT skip evidence gathering steps
- DO NOT propose solutions without supporting evidence
- DO NOT skip debug report file creation when invoked from /orchestrate

**PRIMARY OBLIGATION**: Identifying root cause with evidence is MANDATORY. For /orchestrate invocations, creating debug report file is ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENT.
```

**Transformation Steps**:

1. **Add Opening Directive** (5 min):
   - Similar to doc-writer pattern
   - Emphasize root cause identification as PRIMARY task

2. **Remove Passive "I am" Statements** (10 min):
   - Line 8: "I am a specialized agent" → Removed
   - Lines 10-13: "My role is to..." → Removed

3. **Add Dual-Mode Context** (15 min):
   - Add explanation of standalone vs orchestrate mode
   - File creation only required in orchestrate mode
   - Inline reporting for standalone mode

4. **Search and Replace** (15 min):
   ```bash
   grep -n "I am\|My role\|I can\|I will\|I analyze\|I investigate" .claude/agents/debug-specialist.md
   # Expected: ~10 occurrences
   ```

5. **Verify Transformation** (15 min):
   ```bash
   head -40 .claude/agents/debug-specialist.md | grep -i "^I \|my role"
   # Expected: 0 matches

   head -40 .claude/agents/debug-specialist.md | grep "YOU MUST\|PRIMARY OBLIGATION\|CRITICAL"
   # Expected: 3+ matches
   ```

**Verification Checklist**:
- [ ] "I am" statement removed
- [ ] "YOU MUST perform" added
- [ ] "CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS" block present
- [ ] "PRIMARY OBLIGATION" includes dual-mode context
- [ ] All passive first-person removed

---

### Phase 2: Add Sequential Step Dependencies (1.5 hours)

**Due to length constraints, providing abbreviated structure**:

**Target Structure**:
```markdown
## STEP 1 (REQUIRED BEFORE STEP 2) - Receive Investigation Scope and Determine Mode

**MANDATORY INPUT VERIFICATION**

YOU MUST determine which mode you're operating in:

**Mode 1: Standalone /debug** (inline report):
- Issue description provided
- No debug report file path
- Output: Inline diagnostic report (returned as text)

**Mode 2: /orchestrate Debugging Loop** (file creation):
- Issue description provided
- Debug report file path provided: DEBUG_REPORT_PATH=[path]
- Output: Debug report file at exact path + confirmation

**Verification**:
```bash
if [ -z "$DEBUG_REPORT_PATH" ]; then
  MODE="standalone"
  echo "Mode: Standalone /debug (inline report)"
else
  MODE="orchestrate"
  echo "Mode: Orchestrate debugging (file creation at $DEBUG_REPORT_PATH)"

  # Verify path is absolute
  if [[ ! "$DEBUG_REPORT_PATH" =~ ^/ ]]; then
    echo "CRITICAL ERROR: Path is not absolute: $DEBUG_REPORT_PATH"
    exit 1
  fi
fi

echo "✓ VERIFIED: Mode determined: $MODE"
```

---

## STEP 2 (REQUIRED BEFORE STEP 3) - Gather Evidence

**EXECUTE NOW - Collect All Available Evidence**

**YOU MUST collect** evidence using these tools IN THIS ORDER:

1. **Error Logs** (MANDATORY):
   ```bash
   # Search for error patterns
   Grep { pattern: "error|ERROR|Error", path: ".claude/errors/" }
   Grep { pattern: "$ERROR_PATTERN", path: "logs/" }
   ```

2. **Stack Traces** (REQUIRED if error has trace):
   ```bash
   # Extract full stack trace
   Grep { pattern: "stack traceback|Stack trace|at .*:[0-9]", path: "logs/", -A: 20 }
   ```

3. **Code Context** (MANDATORY):
   ```bash
   # Read files referenced in error
   Read { file_path: "$ERROR_FILE" }

   # Read surrounding context (±20 lines)
   # Use line numbers from error message
   ```

4. **Recent Changes** (REQUIRED):
   ```bash
   # Check git history for recent changes to affected files
   Bash { command: "git log -10 --oneline $ERROR_FILE" }
   ```

5. **Configuration** (MANDATORY):
   ```bash
   # Read relevant configuration
   Read { file_path: "$CONFIG_FILE" }
   ```

**CHECKPOINT**: Emit progress marker:
```
PROGRESS: Evidence gathering complete (N files analyzed, M logs reviewed)
```

---

## STEP 3 (REQUIRED BEFORE STEP 4) - Analyze Evidence and Hypothesize Root Cause

**EXECUTE NOW - Root Cause Analysis**

**YOU MUST form** 2-3 hypotheses based on evidence:

**Hypothesis Formation Criteria** (ALL REQUIRED):
1. **Evidence-Based** (MANDATORY): Every hypothesis MUST be supported by specific evidence
2. **Testable** (REQUIRED): Hypothesis MUST be verifiable through code inspection or testing
3. **Specific** (REQUIRED): Hypothesis MUST identify exact file:line and condition

**Example Hypothesis Format**:
```
Hypothesis 1: Nil Reference Error
- Evidence: Error message "attempt to index nil value (field 'session')" at auth.lua:42
- Root Cause: session_store.validate() returns nil when Redis connection fails
- Code Location: auth.lua:42, session_store.lua:67
- Trigger Condition: Redis connection timeout (>5s)
- Supporting Evidence: Redis logs show connection timeouts at same timestamp
```

**CHECKPOINT**: Emit progress marker:
```
PROGRESS: Root cause analysis complete (N hypotheses formed)
```

---

## STEP 4 (REQUIRED BEFORE STEP 5) - Propose Solutions

**EXECUTE NOW - Solution Development**

**YOU MUST provide** 2-3 solutions with tradeoffs:

**Solution Categories** (REQUIRED):
1. **Quick Fix** (MANDATORY): Immediate workaround, minimal changes
2. **Proper Fix** (REQUIRED): Addresses root cause, requires testing
3. **Long-term Fix** (OPTIONAL): Prevents recurrence, may require refactoring

**Solution Template** (THIS EXACT STRUCTURE):
```markdown
### Solution 1: Quick Fix
**Approach**: [1-sentence description]
**Implementation**:
1. [Step 1]
2. [Step 2]
3. [Step 3]

**Pros**:
- [Advantage 1]
- [Advantage 2]

**Cons**:
- [Limitation 1]
- [Limitation 2]

**Code Changes** (REQUIRED):
```language
// Before (line N)
problematic_code()

// After (line N)
fixed_code()
```

**Testing** (REQUIRED):
- Test case: [description]
- Expected result: [outcome]
```

---

## STEP 5 (ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENT) - Create Debug Report or Return Inline Report

**EXECUTE NOW - Output Generation**

**IF** MODE == "orchestrate" (file creation):

**YOU MUST create** debug report file at exact path specified:

```bash
# Use Write tool to create debug report
Write {
  file_path: "$DEBUG_REPORT_PATH"
  content: |
    # Debug Report: [Issue Description]

    ## Metadata
    - **Date**: [YYYY-MM-DD]
    - **Debug Directory**: debug/
    - **Report Number**: [NNN]
    - **Topic**: [topic_name]
    - **Created By**: /orchestrate (debugging loop)
    - **Workflow**: [workflow_description]
    - **Failed Phase**: [phase_number and name]

    ## Investigation Status
    - **Status**: Root Cause Identified
    - **Severity**: [Critical|High|Medium|Low]

    ## Summary
    - **Issue**: [brief description]
    - **Root Cause**: [identified cause]
    - **Impact**: [scope of failure]

    ## Symptoms
    [Observable behavior, error messages]

    ## Evidence
    ### Error Logs
    ```
    [Log excerpts with timestamps]
    ```

    ### Code Context
    ```language
    // Relevant code at file:line
    ```

    ## Analysis
    ### Root Cause
    [Detailed explanation]

    ### Timeline
    1. [Event 1]
    2. [Event 2]
    3. [Failure point]

    ## Proposed Solutions
    [Solutions from STEP 4]

    ## Recommendation
    [Recommended solution with rationale]
}
```

**MANDATORY VERIFICATION**:
```bash
if [ ! -f "$DEBUG_REPORT_PATH" ]; then
  echo "CRITICAL ERROR: Debug report not created at $DEBUG_REPORT_PATH"
  exit 1
fi

FILE_SIZE=$(wc -c < "$DEBUG_REPORT_PATH")
if [ "$FILE_SIZE" -lt 1000 ]; then
  echo "WARNING: Debug report too small ($FILE_SIZE bytes)"
fi

echo "✓ VERIFIED: Debug report created at $DEBUG_REPORT_PATH"
```

**Return Format**:
```
DEBUG_REPORT_PATH: $DEBUG_REPORT_PATH
```

**ELSE IF** MODE == "standalone" (inline report):

**YOU MUST return** inline diagnostic report (text format):
[Use same structure as file, but return as text instead of creating file]

---
```

**Transformation Steps**:

1. **Identify Current Workflow Structure** (15 min):
   - Lines 54-73: Investigation Process (5 steps)
   - Lines 76-221: Orchestrate Mode (file-based)
   - Need to merge into sequential STEPs

2. **Add STEP Headers** (20 min):

   - STEP 1: Mode determination (new)
   - STEP 2: Evidence gathering
   - STEP 3: Analysis and hypotheses
   - STEP 4: Solution proposals
   - STEP 5: Output generation (mode-dependent)

3. **Add Mode Detection Logic** (15 min):
   - STEP 1: Bash code to detect standalone vs orchestrate
   - Path verification for orchestrate mode

4. **Add Evidence Gathering Enforcement** (20 min):
   - STEP 2: Explicit tool usage (Grep, Read, Bash)
   - Required evidence types listed
   - Progress markers

5. **Add Analysis Structure** (15 min):
   - STEP 3: Hypothesis format template
   - Evidence-based requirement
   - Progress markers

6. **Add Solution Templates** (15 min):
   - STEP 4: 3-tier solution structure
   - Template with pros/cons/code/testing

7. **Test Sequential Flow** (10 min):
   ```bash
   grep -c "### STEP [0-9] (REQUIRED BEFORE" .claude/agents/debug-specialist.md
   # Expected: 5 matches
   ```

**Verification Checklist**:
- [ ] All 5 STEPs defined with dependencies
- [ ] Mode detection logic in STEP 1
- [ ] Evidence gathering tools specified in STEP 2
- [ ] Hypothesis format template in STEP 3
- [ ] Solution templates in STEP 4
- [ ] Dual-mode output in STEP 5

### Phase 3-5: Passive Voice Elimination, Template Enforcement, Completion Criteria (1.5 hours)

**Due to space constraints, using same patterns as doc-writer**:

**Phase 3: Passive Voice** (30 min):
- Search: should/may/can/consider → MUST/WILL/SHALL
- ~25 occurrences estimated
- Focus on error categorization section (lines ~336-364)

**Phase 4: Template Enforcement** (30 min):
- Add "THIS EXACT TEMPLATE" to debug report structure
- Mark all sections as REQUIRED/MANDATORY
- Add validation checklist

**Phase 5: Completion Criteria** (30 min):
- 35+ criteria across 6 categories
- Verification commands for file creation (orchestrate mode)
- Non-compliance consequences

---

### Phase 6: Test debug-specialist.md Migration (1 hour)

**Test 1: File Creation Rate (Orchestrate Mode)** (20 min):

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Test /orchestrate debugging loop invocations

TEST_RUNS=10
SUCCESS_COUNT=0

for i in $(seq 1 $TEST_RUNS); do
  # Simulate orchestrate debugging invocation
  DEBUG_PATH="/tmp/debug_test_${i}.md"

  # Invoke debug-specialist with file path
  # (This would be done via /orchestrate → debug-specialist agent)

**Test 2: Audit Score** (15 min):

```bash
/home/benjamin/.config/.claude/lib/audit-execution-enforcement.sh \
  /home/benjamin/.config/.claude/agents/debug-specialist.md

# Expected: ≥95/100
```

**Test 3: Dual-Mode Operation** (20 min):

```bash
# Test standalone mode (inline report)
/debug "Test failure in auth module" 2>&1 | tee /tmp/debug_standalone.log

# Verify inline report returned (not file creation attempt)
grep -q "## Root Cause" /tmp/debug_standalone.log && echo "✓ Standalone mode works"

# Test orchestrate mode (file creation)
# (Via /orchestrate debugging loop)
```

## 2.3: Migrate test-specialist.md

**Objective**: Transform test-specialist.md using same 5-phase process
**Current Score**: ~40/100 (estimated)
**Target Score**: ≥95/100
**Duration**: 3 hours
**Complexity**: High (4-page file with multi-framework support, progress streaming)

**Abbreviated Migration Plan** (same patterns as debug-specialist):

### Phase 1-5: Full 5-Phase Transformation (2 hours)

**Phase 1: Role Declaration** (20 min):
- Add "YOU MUST perform these exact steps"
- Add "PRIMARY OBLIGATION: Test execution and failure analysis"
- Remove "I am" statements

**Phase 2: Sequential Steps** (40 min):
- STEP 1: Receive test scope and framework detection
- STEP 2: Execute tests
- STEP 3: Parse and categorize results
- STEP 4: Analyze failures (with error analysis tool)
- STEP 5: Generate test report and return results

**Phase 3: Passive Voice** (20 min):
- should/may/can → MUST/WILL/SHALL
- ~20 occurrences estimated

**Phase 4: Template Enforcement** (20 min):
- Test report format template
- Failure categorization template

**Phase 5: Completion Criteria** (20 min):
- 30+ criteria
- Verification commands for test execution
- Non-compliance consequences

### Phase 6: Test test-specialist.md Migration (1 hour)

**Test 1: File Creation Rate** (20 min):
```bash
# Test via /test command (10 invocations)
for i in {1..10}; do
  /test "lua/utils/" 2>&1 | tee /tmp/test_${i}.log
  # Verify test execution and reporting
done
```

**Test 2: Audit Score** (10 min):
```bash
/home/benjamin/.config/.claude/lib/audit-execution-enforcement.sh \
  /home/benjamin/.config/.claude/agents/test-specialist.md
# Expected: ≥95/100
```

**Test 3: Multi-Framework Support** (20 min):
```bash
# Test Lua/plenary framework
/test "lua/module/" --framework=plenary

# Test bash script tests
/test "scripts/" --framework=bats

# Test generic test pattern
/test "tests/"
```

**Test 4: Update Tracking** (10 min):
```csv
Agent,Pre-Migration Score,Post-Migration Score,File Creation Rate,Status
test-specialist.md,~40/100,≥95/100,10/10 (100%),PASSED
```

## Risk Mitigation

### Identified Risks

**Risk 1: Breaking /document, /debug, /test Commands**
- **Mitigation**: Test each agent via its invoking command
- **Status**: All test suites include command-level integration tests

**Risk 2: Template Enforcement Too Strict**
- **Mitigation**: Templates based on existing patterns, not new inventions
- **Status**: All templates validated against current usage

**Risk 3: Time Overruns**
- **Mitigation**: 5-hour buffer included in 18-hour estimate
- **Status**: Phased approach allows early detection of delays

## Appendices

### Appendix A: Reference Enforcement Patterns

**Role Declaration Pattern**:
```markdown
**YOU MUST perform these exact steps in sequence:**

**CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS**:
- [Primary task] is your PRIMARY task (not optional)
- Execute steps in EXACT order shown below
- DO NOT skip [critical step]
- DO NOT [anti-pattern]

**PRIMARY OBLIGATION**: [Core responsibility] is MANDATORY, not optional.
```

**Sequential Step Pattern**:
```markdown
## STEP 1 (REQUIRED BEFORE STEP 2) - [Step Name]

**MANDATORY [ACTION TYPE]**

[Instructions]

**CHECKPOINT**: [Verification requirement]
```

**Verification Block Pattern**:
```bash
**MANDATORY VERIFICATION - [What is being verified]**

```bash
# Verification code
if [ ! -f "$FILE_PATH" ]; then
  echo "CRITICAL ERROR: [Error message]"
  exit 1
fi

echo "✓ VERIFIED: [Success message]"
```
```

**Template Enforcement Pattern**:
```markdown
## [SECTION NAME] - Use THIS EXACT TEMPLATE (No modifications)

```markdown
[Template content with (REQUIRED) and (MANDATORY) markers]
```

**ENFORCEMENT**:
- All sections marked REQUIRED are NON-NEGOTIABLE
- [Specific enforcement rules]
```

**Completion Criteria Pattern**:
```markdown
## COMPLETION CRITERIA - ALL REQUIRED

Before completing your task, YOU MUST verify ALL of these criteria are met:

### [Category 1] (ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENTS)
- [x] Criterion 1
- [x] Criterion 2

### Verification Commands (MUST EXECUTE)
```bash
# Verification script
```

### NON-COMPLIANCE CONSEQUENCES
[Explanation of impact if criteria not met]

### FINAL VERIFICATION CHECKLIST
```
[x] All N requirements from Category 1 met
[x] All M requirements from Category 2 met
```

**Total Requirements**: [X] criteria - ALL must be met (100% compliance)
**Target Score**: 95+/100 on enforcement rubric
```

### Appendix B: Common Transformation Examples

**Before/After: Passive Voice Elimination**:
```markdown
# BEFORE
- You should create the file in the topic directory
- Links may be verified after file creation
- You can add code examples for clarity

# AFTER
- **YOU MUST create** the file at the exact path specified
- **YOU WILL verify** ALL links after file creation using: [verification command]
- **YOU SHALL add** concrete code examples using this template: [template]
```

**Before/After: Template Addition**:
```markdown
# BEFORE
Create a report with:
- Overview
- Findings
- Recommendations

# AFTER
## Report Structure - Use THIS EXACT TEMPLATE (No modifications)

```markdown
# [Topic]

## Overview
[2-3 sentences - REQUIRED]

## Findings
[Detailed analysis - MINIMUM 5 bullet points REQUIRED]

## Recommendations
[Actionable guidance - MINIMUM 3 recommendations REQUIRED]
```

**ENFORCEMENT**:
- All sections marked REQUIRED are NON-NEGOTIABLE
- Missing sections render report INCOMPLETE
```

### Appendix C: Testing Best Practices

**File Creation Rate Testing**:
```bash
# Standard pattern for 10-run test
for i in {1..10}; do
  [invoke agent/command]
  if [ -f "$EXPECTED_FILE" ]; then
    SUCCESS=$((SUCCESS + 1))
  fi
done

echo "Success rate: $((SUCCESS * 100 / 10))%"
[ $SUCCESS -eq 10 ] && exit 0 || exit 1
```

**Audit Score Validation**:
```bash
# Run audit and check score
SCORE=$(/path/to/audit-script.sh file.md | grep "^Score:" | awk '{print $2}' | cut -d'/' -f1)

if [ "$SCORE" -ge 95 ]; then
  echo "✓ PASSED: Score $SCORE/100"
else
  echo "✗ FAILED: Score $SCORE/100 (need ≥95)"
  exit 1
fi
```

**Verification Checkpoint Testing**:
```bash
# Check for required checkpoint markers in output
CHECKPOINTS=(
  "✓ VERIFIED:"
  "CHECKPOINT:"
  "PROGRESS:"
)

for cp in "${CHECKPOINTS[@]}"; do
  grep -q "$cp" output.log || { echo "Missing: $cp"; exit 1; }
done
```
