- No rework required
- Tracking spreadsheet updated

## Stage Overview

This stage applies the complete 5-phase transformation process to the doc-writer.md agent, which is invoked by /document and /orchestrate commands. Achieving 100% file creation rate here is critical as documentation generation affects nearly all workflows.

**Why doc-writer.md is Critical**:
- Invoked by /document command (direct usage)
- Invoked by /orchestrate in documentation phase
- Combined invocations: ~30% of all agent usage
- Current file creation rate: 60-80%
- Target file creation rate: 100%

**Transformation Approach**:
Apply all 5 Standard 0.5 enforcement phases:
1. Role declaration transformation ("I am" → "YOU MUST")
2. Sequential step dependencies ("STEP N REQUIRED BEFORE STEP N+1")
3. Passive voice elimination (should/may/can → MUST/WILL/SHALL)
4. Template enforcement ("THIS EXACT TEMPLATE")
5. Completion criteria ("ALL REQUIRED")

---

## Phase 1: Transform Role Declaration (1 hour)

### Objective
Replace passive descriptive language with imperative directives that establish file creation as the PRIMARY obligation.

### Current State (lines 1-8)
```markdown
---
allowed-tools: Read, Write, Edit, Grep, Glob
description: Specialized in maintaining documentation consistency
---

# Documentation Writer Agent

I am a specialized agent focused on creating and maintaining project documentation.
```

### Target State
```markdown
---
allowed-tools: Read, Write, Edit, Grep, Glob
description: Specialized in maintaining documentation consistency
---

# Documentation Writer Agent

**YOU MUST perform these exact steps in sequence:**

**CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS**:
- File creation/updates are your PRIMARY task (not optional)
- Execute steps in EXACT order shown below
- DO NOT skip verification checkpoints
- DO NOT use relative paths (absolute paths only)
- DO NOT skip documentation updates when code changes detected

**PRIMARY OBLIGATION**: Creating or updating documentation files is MANDATORY, not optional.
```

### Transformation Steps

#### Step 1: Add Opening Directive (5 min)
- Insert "YOU MUST perform these exact steps in sequence" as first line
- Add "CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS" block with 5 bullet points
- Add "PRIMARY OBLIGATION" statement

**Verification**:
```bash
# Verify opening directive present
head -20 .claude/agents/doc-writer.md | grep -q "YOU MUST perform these exact steps"
echo $? # Expected: 0 (found)
```

#### Step 2: Remove Passive "I am" Statements (10 min)
- Line 8: "I am a specialized agent" → Removed (replaced with directives)
- Lines 10-13: "My role is to..." list → Removed (replaced with PRIMARY OBLIGATION)

**Verification**:
```bash
# Verify "I am" removed from role section
head -30 .claude/agents/doc-writer.md | grep -i "^I am\|my role"
echo $? # Expected: 1 (not found)
```

#### Step 3: Search and Replace (15 min)
```bash
# Search for all "I am", "My role", "I can" patterns
grep -n "I am\|My role\|I can\|I will" .claude/agents/doc-writer.md

# Expected hits: ~8 occurrences
# Each must be transformed to imperative "YOU MUST" form
```

**Transformation examples**:
- "I am responsible for" → "YOU MUST"
- "My role is to create" → "YOU WILL create"
- "I can generate" → "YOU SHALL generate"
- "I will ensure" → "YOU MUST ensure"

#### Step 4: Verify Transformation (10 min)
```bash
# Verify zero passive "I" statements in role section
head -30 .claude/agents/doc-writer.md | grep -i "^I \|my role"
# Expected: No matches

# Verify imperative directives present
head -30 .claude/agents/doc-writer.md | grep "YOU MUST\|PRIMARY OBLIGATION\|CRITICAL"
# Expected: 3+ matches
```

#### Step 5: Test Impact (20 min)
```bash
# Run doc-writer via /document command
/document "Test documentation creation" 2>&1 | tee /tmp/doc_writer_test.log

# Verify opening directives are processed
grep -q "YOU MUST" /tmp/doc_writer_test.log
echo "Opening directives test: $?"

# Note: File creation rate testing happens in Phase 6
```

### Verification Checklist
- [ ] "I am" statement removed
- [ ] "YOU MUST perform" added as opening
- [ ] "CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS" block present with 5 directives
- [ ] "PRIMARY OBLIGATION" statement added
- [ ] All passive first-person removed from role section
- [ ] Imperative tone established

### Before/After Comparison
| Aspect | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Opening | "I am a specialized agent" | "YOU MUST perform these exact steps" |
| Tone | Descriptive | Imperative |
| Obligation | Implied | Explicit ("PRIMARY OBLIGATION") |
| Instructions | Suggestions | Directives ("CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS") |

---

## Phase 2: Add Sequential Step Dependencies (1.5 hours)

### Objective
Restructure behavioral guidelines into sequential STEPs with explicit dependencies, ensuring documentation creation follows a mandatory execution flow.

### Current State (lines 77-115)
```markdown
## Behavioral Guidelines

### Documentation Discovery
Before writing documentation:
1. Read existing documentation for style and patterns
2. Check CLAUDE.md for documentation standards
3. Identify what documentation already exists
4. Determine gaps and update needs
```

### Target State
```markdown
## Documentation Creation Process

### STEP 1 (REQUIRED BEFORE STEP 2) - Receive and Verify Documentation Scope

**MANDATORY INPUT VERIFICATION**

The invoking command MUST provide you with documentation requirements. Verify you have received:

```bash
# File paths to create/update
DOC_PATHS="[PATHS PROVIDED IN YOUR PROMPT]"

# Affected code changes (from /document or /orchestrate)
CODE_CHANGES="[CHANGES PROVIDED IN YOUR PROMPT]"

# CRITICAL: Verify paths are absolute
for path in $DOC_PATHS; do
  if [[ ! "$path" =~ ^/ ]]; then
    echo "CRITICAL ERROR: Path is not absolute: $path"
    exit 1
  fi
done

echo "✓ VERIFIED: Absolute documentation paths received: $DOC_PATHS"
```

**CHECKPOINT**: YOU MUST have absolute paths and code change context before proceeding to Step 2.

---

### STEP 2 (REQUIRED BEFORE STEP 3) - Analyze Documentation Requirements

**EXECUTE NOW - Determine Documentation Actions**

**YOU MUST determine** which documentation files need creation vs updates:

**Analysis Checklist** (ALL required):
1. **Check Existing Docs** (MANDATORY):
   ```bash
   # Use Read tool to check if docs exist
   for path in $DOC_PATHS; do
     if [ -f "$path" ]; then
       echo "UPDATE: $path"
       DOCS_TO_UPDATE+=("$path")
     else
       echo "CREATE: $path"
       DOCS_TO_CREATE+=("$path")
     fi
   done
   ```

2. **Review Code Changes** (REQUIRED):
   - New modules → CREATE corresponding README.md
   - Modified APIs → UPDATE existing docs
   - Breaking changes → UPDATE with prominent warnings

3. **Check CLAUDE.md Standards** (MANDATORY):
   - Read project CLAUDE.md using Read tool
   - Extract documentation policy section
   - Extract code standards for examples
   - Verify Unicode box-drawing requirements

**CHECKPOINT**: Emit progress marker:
```
PROGRESS: Documentation analysis complete (N files to create, M files to update)
```

---

### STEP 3 (REQUIRED BEFORE STEP 4) - Create New Documentation Files

**EXECUTE NOW - Create New Documentation**

**IF** `DOCS_TO_CREATE` array is not empty, YOU MUST create each file using Write tool:

**For Each New Documentation File** (ALL REQUIRED):

1. **Determine Content Structure** (MANDATORY):
   - README.md: Use standard template (Purpose, Modules, Examples, Links)
   - API docs: Document functions with signatures, parameters, returns
   - Guides: Step-by-step with code examples

2. **Create File with Write Tool** (ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENT):
   ```bash
   # YOU MUST use Write tool for EACH file in DOCS_TO_CREATE
   # Example:
   Write {
     file_path: "/absolute/path/to/new/README.md"
     content: |
       # Module Name

       Brief description.

       ## Purpose
       [Detailed explanation]

       ## Modules
       [List of files with documentation]

       ## Related Documentation
       [Links to parent and subdirectory READMEs]
   }
   ```

3. **Verify File Creation** (MANDATORY VERIFICATION):
   ```bash
   # After each Write operation
   if [ ! -f "$NEW_DOC_PATH" ]; then
     echo "CRITICAL ERROR: Documentation file not created at $NEW_DOC_PATH"
     exit 1
   fi

   echo "✓ VERIFIED: Created documentation at $NEW_DOC_PATH"
   ```

**CHECKPOINT**: Emit progress for each created file:
```
PROGRESS: Created documentation file (N of M complete)
```

---

### STEP 4 (REQUIRED BEFORE STEP 5) - Update Existing Documentation

**EXECUTE NOW - Update Existing Documentation**

**IF** `DOCS_TO_UPDATE` array is not empty, YOU MUST update each file using Edit tool:

**For Each Existing Documentation File** (ALL REQUIRED):

1. **Read Current Content** (MANDATORY):
   ```bash
   # Use Read tool to examine current documentation
   Read { file_path: "$EXISTING_DOC_PATH" }
   ```

2. **Identify Update Sections** (REQUIRED):
   - Module listings: Add new files, update descriptions
   - API documentation: Update signatures, add new functions
   - Usage examples: Update with new API patterns
   - Breaking changes: Add prominent warnings

3. **Update File with Edit Tool** (ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENT):
   ```bash
   # YOU MUST use Edit tool for EACH file in DOCS_TO_UPDATE
   # Example:
   Edit {
     file_path: "/absolute/path/to/existing/README.md"
     old_string: |
       ## Modules

       ### old_module.lua
       Old description.

     new_string: |
       ## Modules

       ### old_module.lua
       Updated description with new functionality.

       ### new_module.lua
       New module description.
   }
   ```

4. **Verify Update Success** (MANDATORY VERIFICATION):
   ```bash
   # After each Edit operation
   # Re-read file to verify changes applied
   UPDATED_CONTENT=$(Read { file_path: "$EXISTING_DOC_PATH" })
   if [[ ! "$UPDATED_CONTENT" =~ "new_module.lua" ]]; then
     echo "CRITICAL ERROR: Documentation update failed for $EXISTING_DOC_PATH"
     exit 1
   fi

   echo "✓ VERIFIED: Updated documentation at $EXISTING_DOC_PATH"
   ```

**CHECKPOINT**: Emit progress for each updated file:
```
PROGRESS: Updated documentation file (N of M complete)
```

---

### STEP 5 (ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENT) - Verify All Documentation and Return Confirmation

**MANDATORY VERIFICATION - All Documentation Files Complete**

After creating and updating all documentation, YOU MUST verify:

**Verification Checklist** (ALL must be ✓):
- [ ] All files in DOCS_TO_CREATE exist at specified paths
- [ ] All files in DOCS_TO_UPDATE have been modified
- [ ] All documentation follows CLAUDE.md standards:
  - [ ] Unicode box-drawing used (not ASCII art)
  - [ ] No emojis in content
  - [ ] Code examples have syntax highlighting
  - [ ] Cross-references use correct paths
- [ ] All internal links are functional
- [ ] Breaking changes have prominent warnings (if applicable)

**Final Verification Code**:
```bash
# Verify all created files exist
for path in "${DOCS_TO_CREATE[@]}"; do
  if [ ! -f "$path" ]; then
    echo "CRITICAL ERROR: Documentation file not found at: $path"
    exit 1
  fi

  # Verify file is not empty
  FILE_SIZE=$(wc -c < "$path" 2>/dev/null || echo 0)
  if [ "$FILE_SIZE" -lt 200 ]; then
    echo "WARNING: Documentation file is too small (${FILE_SIZE} bytes): $path"
  fi
done

# Verify all updated files were modified
for path in "${DOCS_TO_UPDATE[@]}"; do
  if [ ! -f "$path" ]; then
    echo "CRITICAL ERROR: Documentation file not found at: $path"
    exit 1
  fi
done

echo "✓ VERIFIED: All documentation files complete and saved"
```

**CHECKPOINT REQUIREMENT - Return Confirmation**

After verification, YOU MUST return this confirmation:

```
DOCUMENTATION_UPDATED: Created N files, Updated M files
Paths:
- Created: [list of created file paths]
- Updated: [list of updated file paths]
```

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS**:
- DO NOT return detailed documentation content
- ONLY return file paths and counts
- The orchestrator will read documentation files directly if needed
```

### Transformation Steps

#### Step 1: Restructure Behavioral Guidelines Section (30 min)
- Current: Flat list of 6 guideline subsections
- Target: 5 sequential STEPs with dependencies
- Map guidelines to steps:
  - Documentation Discovery → STEP 1 (Input Verification) + STEP 2 (Analysis)
  - README Structure → STEP 3 (Create New Docs)
  - Code Examples → STEP 4 (Update Existing Docs)
  - Cross-References → STEP 5 (Verification)

#### Step 2: Add STEP Headers with Dependencies (15 min)
- Format: "### STEP N (REQUIRED BEFORE STEP N+1) - [Step Name]"
- Add "EXECUTE NOW" subheaders for action blocks
- Add "MANDATORY" markers for required operations

#### Step 3: Add Verification Blocks (20 min)
- After each file creation: "MANDATORY VERIFICATION"
- After each update: "MANDATORY VERIFICATION"
- At end: "Final Verification Code" with bash checks

#### Step 4: Add Progress Markers (10 min)
- STEP 2: "PROGRESS: Documentation analysis complete"
- STEP 3: "PROGRESS: Created documentation file (N of M complete)"
- STEP 4: "PROGRESS: Updated documentation file (N of M complete)"
- STEP 5: "PROGRESS: All documentation verified"

#### Step 5: Add Checkpoint Requirements (15 min)
- STEP 1: "CHECKPOINT: Paths and context verified"
- STEP 5: "CHECKPOINT REQUIREMENT - Return Confirmation"
- Format specification for return output

#### Step 6: Test Sequential Flow (10 min)
```bash
# Verify all STEP markers present
grep -c "### STEP [0-9] (REQUIRED BEFORE" .claude/agents/doc-writer.md
# Expected: 5 matches

# Verify all EXECUTE NOW markers present
grep -c "EXECUTE NOW" .claude/agents/doc-writer.md
# Expected: 3+ matches

# Verify all CHECKPOINT markers present
grep -c "CHECKPOINT" .claude/agents/doc-writer.md
# Expected: 5+ matches
```

### Verification Checklist
- [ ] All 5 STEPs defined with "REQUIRED BEFORE" dependencies
- [ ] Each STEP has "EXECUTE NOW" action blocks
- [ ] Verification blocks added after file operations
- [ ] Progress markers defined for major milestones
- [ ] Checkpoint requirements added
- [ ] Return format specified explicitly

### Before/After Comparison
| Aspect | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Structure | Flat guidelines list | 5 sequential STEPs |
| Dependencies | Implicit | Explicit ("REQUIRED BEFORE") |
| Execution | Optional interpretation | Mandatory ("EXECUTE NOW") |
| Verification | Implied | Explicit checkpoints |
| Progress | None | Progress markers |

---

## Phase 3: Eliminate Passive Voice (30 min)

### Objective
Replace all passive/suggestive language (should, may, can, consider, try to) with imperative directives (MUST, WILL, SHALL).

### Search Patterns
```bash
# Find all passive voice instances
grep -n "\bshould\b\|\bmay\b\|\bcan\b\|\bconsider\b\|\btry to\b" .claude/agents/doc-writer.md

# Expected hits: ~20-30 occurrences across 6-page file
```

### Transformation Table

| Pattern | Line Estimate | Before | After |
|---------|---------------|--------|-------|
| should | ~8 occurrences | "You should create README" | "YOU MUST create README" |
| may | ~6 occurrences | "You may add examples" | "YOU WILL add examples" |
| can | ~10 occurrences | "You can use Unicode" | "YOU SHALL use Unicode" |
| consider | ~4 occurrences | "Consider including links" | "YOU MUST include links" |
| try to | ~2 occurrences | "Try to verify links" | "YOU WILL verify links" |

### Detailed Examples

#### Example 1: Documentation Requirements (lines 40-44 estimated)
```markdown
# BEFORE
**README Requirements**: Every subdirectory should have README.md containing:
- **Purpose**: Clear explanation of directory role
- **Module Documentation**: Documentation for each file/module
- You may include usage examples where applicable

# AFTER
**README Requirements**: Every subdirectory MUST have README.md containing:
- **Purpose**: Clear explanation of directory role (REQUIRED)
- **Module Documentation**: Documentation for each file/module (MANDATORY)
- **Usage Examples**: YOU SHALL include usage examples for all public APIs (REQUIRED)
```

#### Example 2: Documentation Format (lines 46-52 estimated)
```markdown
# BEFORE
**Documentation Format**:
- Use clear, concise language
- Include code examples with syntax highlighting
- You should use Unicode box-drawing for diagrams
- No emojis in file content
- You can follow CommonMark specification

# AFTER
**Documentation Format** (ALL REQUIRED):
- **YOU MUST use** clear, concise language (no jargon without definitions)
- **YOU WILL include** code examples with syntax highlighting (markdown code blocks REQUIRED)
- **YOU SHALL use** Unicode box-drawing for diagrams (ASCII art is FORBIDDEN)
- **NO emojis** in file content (UTF-8 encoding issues - ABSOLUTE PROHIBITION)
- **YOU MUST follow** CommonMark specification (deviations are UNACCEPTABLE)
```

#### Example 3: Documentation Updates (lines 54-57 estimated)
```markdown
# BEFORE
**Documentation Updates**:
- Update documentation with code changes
- Keep examples current with implementation
- You should document breaking changes prominently

# AFTER
**Documentation Updates** (ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENTS):
- **YOU MUST update** documentation with ALL code changes (no exceptions)
- **YOU WILL keep** examples current with implementation (outdated examples are UNACCEPTABLE)
- **YOU SHALL document** breaking changes prominently with ⚠️ warning markers (MANDATORY)
```

#### Example 4: Cross-References (lines 120-127 estimated)
```markdown
# BEFORE
### Cross-References
- Use relative paths for internal links
- Verify links are not broken
- You may link to specific sections with anchors when appropriate
- Reference specs with proper format

# AFTER
### Cross-References (ALL MANDATORY)
- **YOU MUST use** relative paths for internal links (absolute paths are FORBIDDEN for internal links)
- **YOU WILL verify** ALL links are not broken using this verification: [test -f "$LINK_TARGET"]
- **YOU SHALL link** to specific sections with markdown anchors when accuracy requires it (REQUIRED for deep linking)
- **YOU MUST reference** specs with this exact format: `specs/{NNN_topic}/[plans|reports]/NNN_filename.md` (other formats are INVALID)
```

### Transformation Steps

#### Step 1: Search and Replace "should" → "MUST" (5 min)
```bash
# Find all instances
grep -n "\bshould\b" .claude/agents/doc-writer.md

# Manual replacement required (context-dependent)
# Each instance: "should" → "MUST" + add "(REQUIRED)" or "(MANDATORY)"
```

#### Step 2: Search and Replace "may" → "WILL" or "SHALL" (5 min)
```bash
# "may" for optional → "WILL" for default behavior
# "may" for alternatives → "SHALL" for requirements
```

#### Step 3: Search and Replace "can" → "SHALL" or "MUST" (5 min)
```bash
# "can" for ability → "SHALL" for capability requirement
# "can" for permission → "MUST" for obligation
```

#### Step 4: Search and Replace "consider" → "MUST" (3 min)
```bash
# All "consider" instances are suggestions
# Transform to mandatory: "consider X" → "YOU MUST X"
```

#### Step 5: Search and Replace "try to" → "WILL" (2 min)
```bash
# "try to" implies optional effort
# Transform to commitment: "try to X" → "YOU WILL X"
```

#### Step 6: Verify Zero Passive Voice (10 min)
```bash
# Re-run search for all passive patterns
grep -n "\bshould\b\|\bmay\b\|\bcan\b\|\bconsider\b\|\btry to\b" .claude/agents/doc-writer.md
# Expected: 0 matches (or only in quoted examples/negative statements)

# Count strong imperatives
grep -c "YOU MUST\|YOU WILL\|YOU SHALL\|MANDATORY\|REQUIRED" .claude/agents/doc-writer.md
# Expected: 40+ matches
```

### Verification Checklist
- [ ] Zero instances of "should" (except in examples/quotes)
- [ ] Zero instances of "may" (except in examples/quotes)
- [ ] Zero instances of "can" (except in examples/quotes)
- [ ] Zero instances of "consider" (except in examples/quotes)
- [ ] Zero instances of "try to" (except in examples/quotes)
- [ ] 40+ instances of "YOU MUST", "YOU WILL", "YOU SHALL"
- [ ] All requirements marked as "(REQUIRED)" or "(MANDATORY)"

### Quality Check
After transformation, ensure:
- Imperatives are contextually appropriate (not overly aggressive)
- Requirements are specific (not vague like "YOU MUST do better")
- Forbidden patterns explicitly stated (e.g., "ASCII art is FORBIDDEN")

## Phase 4: Add Template Enforcement (30 min)

### Objective
Add "THIS EXACT TEMPLATE" markers to all template sections with explicit enforcement requirements and validation checklists.

### Current State (lines 86-115 estimated)
```markdown
### README Structure
Standard README format:
```markdown
# Directory/Module Name

Brief description of purpose.

## Purpose

Detailed explanation of role and responsibilities.

## Modules

### module_name.ext
Description of what this module does.

...
```
```

### Target State
```markdown
### README Structure - Use THIS EXACT TEMPLATE (No modifications)

**ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENT**: All README files YOU create MUST use this structure:

```markdown

```

### Transformation Steps

#### Step 1: Identify Template Sections (10 min)
- Current templates in agent:
  - README Structure (lines ~86-115)
  - Code Examples (implied, not templated)
  - Cross-References (lines ~120-127)
- Need to add "THIS EXACT TEMPLATE" markers to each

#### Step 2: Add Template Enforcement Markers (10 min)
- Before each template: "Use THIS EXACT TEMPLATE (No modifications)"
- After each template: "ENFORCEMENT" block with requirements
- Mark all sections as "(REQUIRED)" or "(MANDATORY)"

#### Step 3: Add Template Validation Checklists (5 min)
- After each template: Checklist with verification criteria
- All items must be verifiable (objective, not subjective)

#### Step 4: Add Explicit Minimums (3 min)
- Purpose section: "MINIMUM 2 paragraphs REQUIRED"
- Module descriptions: "MINIMUM 2 sentences REQUIRED"
- Examples: "MUST be executable and tested"

#### Step 5: Test Template Enforcement (2 min)
```bash
# Verify "THIS EXACT TEMPLATE" markers present
grep -c "THIS EXACT TEMPLATE" .claude/agents/doc-writer.md
# Expected: 1+ matches (one per template section)

# Verify "ENFORCEMENT" blocks present
grep -c "^\\*\\*ENFORCEMENT\\*\\*:" .claude/agents/doc-writer.md
# Expected: 1+ matches

# Verify validation checklists present
grep -c "TEMPLATE VALIDATION CHECKLIST" .claude/agents/doc-writer.md
# Expected: 1+ matches
```

### Verification Checklist
- [ ] "THIS EXACT TEMPLATE" marker added to README structure
- [ ] "ENFORCEMENT" block added with 4+ requirements
- [ ] All template sections marked as "(REQUIRED)" or "(MANDATORY)"
- [ ] Explicit minimums added (2 paragraphs, 2 sentences, etc.)
- [ ] Template validation checklist added
- [ ] All checklist items are objective (verifiable)

### Before/After Comparison
| Aspect | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Template intro | "Standard README format:" | "Use THIS EXACT TEMPLATE (No modifications)" |
| Section labels | Plain headings | "(REQUIRED)" and "(MANDATORY)" markers |
| Minimums | Implied | Explicit ("MINIMUM 2 paragraphs") |

- [x] All progress markers emitted at required milestones
- [x] No verification checkpoints skipped

### Return Format (STRICT REQUIREMENT)
- [x] Return format is EXACTLY: `DOCUMENTATION_UPDATED: Created N files, Updated M files`
- [x] File paths listed in return message
- [x] No full documentation content returned (orchestrator will read files directly)

### Verification Commands (MUST EXECUTE)

Execute these verifications before returning:

```bash
# 1. All created files exist check
for path in "${DOCS_TO_CREATE[@]}"; do
  test -f "$path" || echo "CRITICAL ERROR: File not found at $path"
done

# 2. All created files have content (minimum 200 bytes)
for path in "${DOCS_TO_CREATE[@]}"; do
  FILE_SIZE=$(wc -c < "$path" 2>/dev/null || echo 0)
  [ "$FILE_SIZE" -ge 200 ] || echo "WARNING: File too small ($FILE_SIZE bytes): $path"
done

# 3. All updated files exist check
for path in "${DOCS_TO_UPDATE[@]}"; do
  test -f "$path" || echo "CRITICAL ERROR: File not found at $path"
done

# 4. Unicode box-drawing verification (no ASCII art)
for path in "${DOCS_TO_CREATE[@]}" "${DOCS_TO_UPDATE[@]}"; do
  grep -q "+---\+\|+===\+" "$path" && echo "WARNING: ASCII art detected in $path (use Unicode box-drawing)"
done

# 5. Emoji check (should be zero)
for path in "${DOCS_TO_CREATE[@]}" "${DOCS_TO_UPDATE[@]}"; do
  grep -qP "[\x{1F300}-\x{1F9FF}]" "$path" && echo "CRITICAL ERROR: Emoji detected in $path"
done

echo "✓ VERIFIED: All completion criteria met"
```

### NON-COMPLIANCE CONSEQUENCES

**Creating incomplete documentation is UNACCEPTABLE** because:
- Downstream commands depend on complete, standards-compliant documentation
- Incomplete docs break cross-references and navigation
- Missing examples prevent developers from using APIs correctly
- Non-compliant formatting creates inconsistency across project
- The purpose of using a specialized agent is to ensure quality

**If you skip file creation:**
- The orchestrator will execute fallback creation
- Your detailed documentation work will be reduced to basic templated content
- Quality will degrade from excellent to minimal
- The purpose of using doc-writer agent is defeated

**If you skip template compliance:**
- Documentation structure becomes inconsistent
- Automated documentation tools may fail
- Developers cannot rely on predictable documentation structure

**If you skip standards compliance:**
- ASCII art breaks rendering in some terminals
- Emojis cause UTF-8 encoding issues
- Missing syntax highlighting makes code unreadable
- Broken links frustrate users

### FINAL VERIFICATION CHECKLIST

Before returning, mentally verify:
```
[x] All 5 file creation/update requirements met
[x] All 5 content completeness requirements met
[x] All 6 standards compliance requirements met
[x] All 4 template adherence requirements met
[x] All 7 process compliance requirements met
[x] Return format is exact (DOCUMENTATION_UPDATED: ...)
[x] Verification commands executed successfully
```

**Total Requirements**: 32 criteria - ALL must be met (100% compliance)

**Target Score**: 95+/100 on enforcement rubric
```

### Transformation Steps

#### Step 1: Transform Quality Checklist to Completion Criteria (10 min)
- Rename section: "Quality Checklist" → "COMPLETION CRITERIA - ALL REQUIRED"
- Group criteria into categories:
  - File Creation/Updates
  - Content Completeness
  - Standards Compliance
  - Template Adherence
  - Process Compliance
  - Return Format

#### Step 2: Add Verification Commands (10 min)
- Add "Verification Commands (MUST EXECUTE)" section
- Include 5 bash verification scripts:
  - File existence checks
  - File size checks (>200 bytes)
  - ASCII art detection (forbidden)
  - Emoji detection (forbidden)
  - Final confirmation

#### Step 3: Add Non-Compliance Consequences (5 min)
- Add "NON-COMPLIANCE CONSEQUENCES" section
- Explain impact of skipping file creation
- Explain impact of skipping template compliance
- Explain impact of skipping standards compliance

#### Step 4: Add Final Verification Checklist (3 min)
- Add mental checklist with category totals
- Show total requirements: 32 criteria
- Show target score: 95+/100

#### Step 5: Test Completion Criteria (2 min)
```bash
# Verify "COMPLETION CRITERIA" section exists
grep -c "## COMPLETION CRITERIA - ALL REQUIRED" .claude/agents/doc-writer.md
# Expected: 1 match

# Verify verification commands present
grep -c "### Verification Commands (MUST EXECUTE)" .claude/agents/doc-writer.md
# Expected: 1 match

# Verify non-compliance section present
grep -c "### NON-COMPLIANCE CONSEQUENCES" .claude/agents/doc-writer.md
# Expected: 1 match

# Count total criteria (checkboxes in completion criteria)
grep -c "^- \[x\]" .claude/agents/doc-writer.md | tail -1
# Expected: 32+ matches
```

### Verification Checklist
