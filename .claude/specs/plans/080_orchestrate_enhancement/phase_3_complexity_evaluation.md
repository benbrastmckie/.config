# Phase 3: Complexity Evaluation - Automated Plan Analysis

## Metadata
- **Phase Number**: 3
- **Phase Name**: Complexity Evaluation - Automated Plan Analysis
- **Parent Plan**: [080_orchestrate_enhancement.md](../080_orchestrate_enhancement.md)
- **Complexity Score**: 8/10
- **Expansion Reason**: Algorithmic design, multi-factor analysis, and critical role in downstream automation
- **Dependencies**: depends_on: [phase_1, phase_2]
- **Estimated Duration**: 6-8 hours
- **Risk Level**: High (algorithm accuracy affects all downstream expansion decisions)

## Objective

Implement automated complexity evaluation system that analyzes implementation plans, calculates multi-factor complexity scores, and determines which phases MUST be expanded to separate files. This system enables intelligent plan organization by identifying high-complexity phases that require detailed expansion before implementation.

## Overview

This phase creates the analytical foundation for adaptive plan organization by implementing:

1. **Weighted Complexity Formula**: Multi-factor algorithm balancing task count, file dependencies, risk factors, testing scope, and dependency chain depth
2. **complexity-estimator Agent**: Specialized agent that analyzes plan structure and returns structured complexity reports
3. **Threshold Configuration**: CLAUDE.md integration for project-specific complexity tolerances
4. **Metadata Injection**: Automatic insertion of complexity scores into plan files for transparency
5. **Expansion Triggering**: Automated decision-making for when to invoke expansion-specialist

The complexity evaluation system runs after plan creation (Phase 2) and before implementation (Phase 5), ensuring plans are optimally structured before execution begins.

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Complexity formula produces scores 0.0-15.0 with clear normalization
- [ ] complexity-estimator agent returns structured YAML reports
- [ ] Scores accurately reflect manual complexity assessment (95%+ correlation)
- [ ] Thresholds loaded from CLAUDE.md `adaptive_planning_config` section
- [ ] Plans automatically injected with complexity metadata
- [ ] Expansion recommendations trigger expansion-specialist correctly
- [ ] Error handling covers malformed plans, missing metadata, invalid YAML
- [ ] Performance: <5 seconds for plans up to 50 phases

## Architecture

### Complexity Score Components

The complexity score is a weighted combination of 5 factors:

```yaml
Components:
 task_count:
  weight: 0.30
  rationale: Task volume is primary complexity driver
  measurement: Count of checkbox items per phase

 file_references:
  weight: 0.20
  rationale: More files = more integration complexity
  measurement: Count of unique file paths in phase

 dependency_depth:
  weight: 0.20
  rationale: Complex dependency chains increase coordination overhead
  measurement: Maximum chain length from dependency graph

 test_scope:
  weight: 0.15
  rationale: Comprehensive testing adds complexity
  measurement: Count of test-related tasks and commands

 risk_factors:
  weight: 0.15
  rationale: High-risk operations require extra care
  measurement: Presence of keywords (security, migration, breaking, API)
```

**Total Weight**: 1.00 (100%)

### Normalization Strategy

Raw scores normalized to 0.0-15.0 scale:

```
normalized_score = min(15.0, raw_score * normalization_factor)

Where:
 normalization_factor = 15.0 / expected_max_raw_score
 expected_max_raw_score = (30 tasks * 0.3) + (30 files * 0.2) + (5 depth * 0.2) + (10 tests * 0.15) + (5 risks * 0.15)
             = 9.0 + 6.0 + 1.0 + 1.5 + 0.75
             = 18.25

 normalization_factor = 15.0 / 18.25 = 0.822
```

This ensures scores typically range 0.0-12.0 with extreme cases capping at 15.0.

### Threshold Configuration

Thresholds read from CLAUDE.md section:

```markdown
<!-- SECTION: adaptive_planning_config -->
## Adaptive Planning Configuration

### Complexity Thresholds

- **Expansion Threshold**: 8.0 (phases above this score → Level 1 expansion)
- **Task Count Threshold**: 10 (phases with >N tasks → expand regardless of score)
- **File Reference Threshold**: 10 (phases with >N files → increased complexity)
- **Replan Limit**: 2 (max auto-replans during /implement)
<!-- END_SECTION: adaptive_planning_config -->
```

**Configuration Priority**:
1. Project-specific CLAUDE.md (subdirectory-specific overrides)
2. Root CLAUDE.md (project defaults)
3. Hardcoded defaults (expansion: 8.0, task: 10, file: 10)

## Stage 1: Design Weighted Complexity Formula

**Objective**: Design and document the mathematical complexity formula with specific coefficients, normalization approach, and validation metrics.

**Duration**: 1-2 hours

**Note**: For current threshold values (expansion threshold, task count threshold, file reference threshold), see [CLAUDE.md adaptive_planning_config](../../../CLAUDE.md#adaptive_planning_config). This stage documents the underlying formula weights, normalization algorithm, and measurement methodology that drive those thresholds.

### Tasks

- [ ] **Document weighted formula specification**
 - Define 5 complexity factors (task_count, file_references, dependency_depth, test_scope, risk_factors)
 - Assign weights: 0.30, 0.20, 0.20, 0.15, 0.15 (totaling 1.00)
 - Document rationale for each weight assignment
 - Create formula spec document: `.claude/docs/reference/complexity-formula-spec.md`

- [ ] **Design normalization algorithm**
 - Calculate expected maximum raw score (18.25 based on typical max values)
 - Define normalization factor: 15.0 / 18.25 = 0.822
 - Implement capping at 15.0 for extreme outliers
 - Document edge cases: 0 tasks, negative values, infinity handling
 - Add examples:
  ```
  Low complexity: 3 tasks, 2 files, 0 deps, 1 test, 0 risks → Score 1.9
  Medium complexity: 8 tasks, 5 files, 1 dep, 3 tests, 1 risk → Score 5.3
  High complexity: 15 tasks, 12 files, 2 deps, 5 tests, 2 risks → Score 8.7
  Extreme complexity: 30 tasks, 25 files, 5 deps, 10 tests, 5 risks → Score 14.2
  ```

- [ ] **Define measurement methodology for each factor**
 - **task_count**: `grep -c "^- \[ \]" phase_content` (count unchecked checkboxes)
 - **file_references**: `grep -oE '(\w+/)+\w+\.\w+' | sort -u | wc -l` (unique file paths)
 - **dependency_depth**: Parse `depends_on: [...]` metadata, build graph, find max chain length
 - **test_scope**: `grep -c "test\|spec\|coverage" phase_content` (test-related keywords)
 - **risk_factors**: `grep -c "security\|migration\|breaking\|API\|database schema" phase_content` (high-risk keywords)
 - Document measurement commands in formula spec

- [ ] **Create validation dataset**
 - Manually assess complexity of 10 existing plans (from specs/plans/)
 - Rate each plan phase 1-15 based on human judgment
 - Document ground truth ratings in `.claude/tests/fixtures/complexity/ground_truth.yaml`
 - Use for correlation testing in Stage 2

- [ ] **Design coefficient tuning process**
 - Define tuning methodology: Compare algorithm scores vs ground truth
 - Calculate correlation coefficient (target >0.90)
 - Document weight adjustment procedure if correlation <0.90
 - Plan for iterative refinement based on real-world usage

### Testing

```bash
# Test formula documentation completeness
test -f /home/benjamin/.config/.claude/docs/reference/complexity-formula-spec.md
grep -q "task_count.*0.30" /home/benjamin/.config/.claude/docs/reference/complexity-formula-spec.md

# Test normalization examples
# Verify low complexity example: 3 tasks * 0.3 * 0.822 = 0.74 (base) + other factors = ~1.9
# Verify high complexity example produces score >8.0

# Test ground truth dataset
test -f /home/benjamin/.config/.claude/tests/fixtures/complexity/ground_truth.yaml
grep -q "phase_.*complexity:" /home/benjamin/.config/.claude/tests/fixtures/complexity/ground_truth.yaml
```

### Expected Outcomes

- Complete formula specification document with mathematical details
- Normalization algorithm preventing score inflation
- Measurement methodology for automated factor extraction
- Validation dataset with 10+ manually-rated plan phases
- Tuning process for weight refinement

## Stage 2: Create complexity-estimator Agent

**Objective**: Implement the complexity-estimator agent that reads plan files, applies the weighted formula, and returns structured complexity reports.

**Duration**: 2-3 hours

### Tasks

    file_reference_threshold: 10
  ```
 - Specify output format (YAML structure, see below)
 - Include error handling instructions for malformed plans

- [ ] **Implement factor extraction logic**

  ```bash
  # Extract phase content between ### Phase N: and next ### Phase or end
  # Count checkboxes: grep -c "^- \[ \]"
  # Weight: task_count * 0.3
  ```
 - **File Reference Extraction**:
  ```bash
  # Extract all file paths: grep -oE '([a-zA-Z0-9_-]+/)+[a-zA-Z0-9_-]+\.[a-zA-Z0-9]+'
  # Remove duplicates: sort -u
  # Count: wc -l
  # Weight: file_count * 0.2
  ```
 - **Dependency Depth Extraction**:
  ```bash
  # Parse dependency metadata: grep "depends_on:" phase_content
  # Build dependency graph (phase -> [dependencies])
  # Calculate max chain length using recursive traversal
  # Weight: depth * 0.2
  ```
 - **Test Scope Extraction**:
  ```bash
  # Count test-related tasks: grep -ic "test\|spec\|coverage\|testing"
  # Weight: test_count * 0.15
  ```
 - **Risk Factor Extraction**:
  ```bash
  # Count high-risk keywords: grep -ic "security\|migration\|breaking\|API\|schema\|authentication\|authorization"
  # Weight: risk_count * 0.15
  ```

- [ ] **Implement weighted formula calculation**
 - Calculate raw score: `(task * 0.3) + (files * 0.2) + (depth * 0.2) + (tests * 0.15) + (risks * 0.15)`
 - Apply normalization: `normalized = min(15.0, raw * 0.822)`
 - Round to 1 decimal place: `rounded = round(normalized, 1)`
 - Classify complexity:
  ```
  0.0-3.0: Low
  3.1-6.0: Medium
  6.1-8.0: Medium-High
  8.1-12.0: High
  12.1-15.0: Very High
  ```

- [ ] **Define structured output format**
 ```yaml
 complexity_report:
  plan_path: "/path/to/027_auth.md"
  analysis_timestamp: "2025-10-21T14:32:00Z"

   expansion_count: 2
   average_complexity: 5.8
   max_complexity: 8.5
   recommendation: "2 phases recommended for expansion before implementation"
 ```

- [ ] **Implement error handling**
 - **Malformed plan file**: Missing phase headers, invalid markdown structure
  - Detection: Check for `### Phase N:` patterns
  - Response: Return error report with specific line numbers
 - **Missing metadata**: No dependency information, no task checkboxes
  - Detection: Check for `- [ ]` patterns, `depends_on:` metadata
  - Response: Return partial report with warnings
 - **Invalid YAML dependencies**: Syntax errors in `depends_on: [...]`
  - Detection: Try parsing YAML, catch exceptions
  - Response: Skip dependency depth calculation, log warning
 - **File read errors**: Permission denied, file not found
  - Detection: Check file existence before reading
  - Response: Return error with file path and error type

- [ ] **Add agent behavioral guidelines**
 - "NEVER modify the plan file during analysis"
 - "Return only structured YAML output, no conversational text"
 - "Include all phases in report, even if complexity is 0.0"
 - "Document any assumptions made during analysis"
 - "Report warnings for ambiguous or unclear plan structure"

## Stage 3: Integrate Complexity Analysis into orchestrate.md

**Objective**: Add complexity evaluation invocation point in /orchestrate command after plan creation, extract complexity reports, and store expansion recommendations in workflow state.

**Duration**: 1-2 hours

### Tasks

- [ ] **Add Phase 2.5 to orchestrate.md workflow**
 - Insert new section after Phase 2 (Planning) completion
 - Title: "Phase 2.5: Complexity Evaluation and Expansion Analysis"

 - Example invocation:
  ```yaml
  Task:
   subagent_type: "general-purpose"
   description: "Analyze plan complexity and recommend expansion"
   prompt: |
    Read and follow the behavioral guidelines from:
    /home/benjamin/.config/.claude/agents/complexity-estimator.md

    You are acting as a Complexity Estimator Agent.

    ANALYSIS TASK: Calculate complexity scores for all phases

    Input:
     plan_path: "{plan_path_from_phase_2}"
     thresholds:
      expansion_threshold: 8.0
      task_count_threshold: 10
      file_reference_threshold: 10

  ```

MANDATORY VERIFICATION CHECKPOINT:
```bash
# Verify complexity-estimator produced valid output
if [ -z "$COMPLEXITY_ESTIMATOR_OUTPUT" ]; then
  echo "ERROR: complexity-estimator agent returned empty output"
  echo "FALLBACK: Creating minimal complexity report with conservative estimates"
  COMPLEXITY_ESTIMATOR_OUTPUT=$(cat <<'EOF'
phases:
  - phase_number: 1
    complexity_score: 5.0
    recommendation: "Manual review required"
summary:
  phases_to_expand: []
  expansion_count: 0
  average_complexity: 5.0
  max_complexity: 5.0
  recommendation: "Manual complexity analysis required - agent failed"
EOF
)
fi

# Verify output contains required fields
if ! echo "$COMPLEXITY_ESTIMATOR_OUTPUT" | grep -q "phases:"; then
  echo "ERROR: complexity-estimator output missing 'phases:' field"
  echo "FALLBACK: Using conservative fallback report"
fi

echo "Verification complete: Complexity report validated"
```
End verification. Proceed only if complexity report exists.

- [ ] **Extract complexity report from agent response**
 - Parse YAML output from complexity-estimator
 - Extract key fields:
  - `phases[]`: Array of phase complexity objects
  - `summary.phases_to_expand[]`: Array of phase numbers needing expansion
  - `summary.expansion_count`: Count of phases to expand
  - `summary.recommendation`: Human-readable summary
 - Handle parsing errors with fallback to manual expansion decision

- [ ] **Store expansion recommendations in workflow state**
 - Create workflow state object:
  ```yaml
  workflow_state:
   plan_path: "/path/to/027_auth.md"
   complexity_report:
    phases_to_expand: [2, 4]
    expansion_count: 2
    average_complexity: 5.8
    max_complexity: 8.5
   expansion_pending: true # Flag for Phase 4 (expansion)
  ```
 - Pass state to subsequent phases

- [ ] **Display complexity summary to user**
 - Format user-friendly summary:
  ```
  ✓ Phase 2.5: Complexity Evaluation Complete

  Plan Analysis: 027_auth_implementation.md
  Total Phases: 5
  Average Complexity: 5.8

  Complexity Breakdown:
   Phase 1: Setup and Configuration    | 3.2 (Medium)   | ✓ No expansion
   Phase 2: Backend Implementation    | 8.5 (High)    | ⚠ Expansion recommended
   Phase 3: Frontend Integration     | 5.1 (Medium)   | ✓ No expansion
   Phase 4: Testing and Security Review  | 7.9 (Medium-High)| ✓ No expansion
   Phase 5: Documentation and Deployment | 4.2 (Medium)   | ✓ No expansion

  Recommendation: 1 phase requires expansion before implementation
  Next: Phase 4 (Plan Expansion)
  ```
 - Use colored output if terminal supports it (green ✓, yellow ⚠)

- [ ] **Add conditional branching logic**
 - If `expansion_count > 0`:
  - Set `workflow_state.expansion_pending = true`
  - Proceed to Phase 4 (Plan Expansion with expansion-specialist)
 - If `expansion_count == 0`:
  - Set `workflow_state.expansion_pending = false`
  - Skip Phase 4, proceed directly to Phase 5 (Implementation)
  - Display: "✓ No expansion needed, proceeding to implementation"

- [ ] **Add error recovery for complexity analysis failures**
 - If complexity-estimator fails (parsing error, agent error):
  - Log warning: "Complexity analysis failed, proceeding without expansion"
  - Set `workflow_state.expansion_pending = false`
  - Continue to implementation without expansion
  - Store error details in workflow state for debugging

### Testing

```bash
# Test orchestrate.md with simple plan (no expansion needed)
/orchestrate "Fix typo in README.md"
# Verify: Phase 2.5 runs complexity-estimator
# Verify: Complexity summary displayed
# Verify: "No expansion needed" message shown
# Verify: Phase 4 skipped, proceeds to Phase 5

# Test orchestrate.md with complex plan (expansion recommended)
/orchestrate "Implement authentication with OAuth, JWT, 2FA, and session management"
# Verify: Phase 2.5 calculates high complexity scores
# Verify: Expansion summary shows "2 phases require expansion"
# Verify: workflow_state.expansion_pending = true
# Verify: Proceeds to Phase 4 (expansion-specialist invoked)

# Test error handling
# Simulate complexity-estimator failure (e.g., malformed plan)
# Verify: Error logged, workflow continues without expansion
# Verify: No crash or hang
```

### Expected Outcomes

- Phase 2.5 added to orchestrate.md workflow
- complexity-estimator invoked automatically after planning
- Complexity summary displayed to user
- Expansion recommendations stored in workflow state
- Conditional branching to expansion phase working
- Error recovery prevents workflow failure

---

## Stage 4: Implement Threshold Configuration Reading

**Objective**: Read complexity thresholds from CLAUDE.md `adaptive_planning_config` section and pass to complexity-estimator, supporting project-specific and subdirectory-specific overrides.

**Duration**: 1 hour

### Tasks

- [ ] **Create threshold extraction utility**
 - File: `.claude/lib/complexity-thresholds.sh`
 - Function: `get_complexity_thresholds()`
 - Search order:
  1. Current directory's CLAUDE.md (subdirectory-specific)
  2. Parent directories upward to project root (recursive search)
  3. Hardcoded defaults if no CLAUDE.md found
 - Extract section using markers:
  ```bash
  # Extract adaptive_planning_config section
  sed -n '/<!-- SECTION: adaptive_planning_config -->/,/<!-- END_SECTION: adaptive_planning_config -->/p' CLAUDE.md
  ```
 - Parse threshold values:
  ```bash
  # Extract expansion_threshold
  grep "Expansion Threshold:" | grep -oE '[0-9]+\.[0-9]+'

  # Extract task_count_threshold
  grep "Task Count Threshold:" | grep -oE '[0-9]+'

  # Extract file_reference_threshold
  grep "File Reference Threshold:" | grep -oE '[0-9]+'

  # Extract replan_limit
  grep "Replan Limit:" | grep -oE '[0-9]+'
  ```

- [ ] **Define default threshold values**
 - Hardcoded fallbacks when CLAUDE.md not found:
  ```yaml
  defaults:
   expansion_threshold: 8.0
   task_count_threshold: 10
   file_reference_threshold: 10
   replan_limit: 2
  ```
 - Document defaults in `.claude/docs/reference/complexity-defaults.md`

- [ ] **Implement threshold override mechanism**
 - Subdirectory CLAUDE.md overrides parent CLAUDE.md
 - Example: `nvim/CLAUDE.md` overrides root `CLAUDE.md` for nvim/ subdirectory
 - Support partial overrides (only some thresholds specified):
  ```markdown
  <!-- SECTION: adaptive_planning_config -->
  ## Adaptive Planning Configuration
  - **Expansion Threshold**: 5.0 # Override: more aggressive expansion
  <!-- Inherit other thresholds from parent CLAUDE.md -->
  <!-- END_SECTION: adaptive_planning_config -->
  ```
 - Merge parent thresholds with subdirectory thresholds (subdirectory wins)

- [ ] **Integrate threshold loading into orchestrate.md**
 - Before Phase 2.5 (complexity evaluation):
  - Invoke threshold extraction utility
  - Load thresholds based on plan location
  - Store in workflow state
 - Pass thresholds to complexity-estimator agent:
  ```yaml
  complexity_estimator_input:
   thresholds:
    expansion_threshold: 8.0 # From CLAUDE.md
    task_count_threshold: 10
    file_reference_threshold: 10
  ```

- [ ] **Add threshold validation**
 - Validate extracted thresholds:
  - `expansion_threshold`: 0.0 ≤ value ≤ 15.0
  - `task_count_threshold`: 1 ≤ value ≤ 50
  - `file_reference_threshold`: 1 ≤ value ≤ 100
  - `replan_limit`: 1 ≤ value ≤ 5
 - If invalid, log warning and use defaults
 - Display to user: "Using custom complexity thresholds from CLAUDE.md"

- [ ] **Document threshold configuration in CLAUDE.md**
 - Update root CLAUDE.md with threshold configuration section
 - Add examples for different project types:
  - Research-heavy (aggressive expansion): threshold 5.0
  - Simple web app (conservative expansion): threshold 10.0
  - Mission-critical (maximum organization): threshold 3.0
 - Link to complexity formula spec for details

### Testing

```bash
# Test threshold extraction from CLAUDE.md
bash .claude/lib/complexity-thresholds.sh get_complexity_thresholds
# Expected: expansion_threshold=8.0, task_count_threshold=10, ...

# Test default fallback when CLAUDE.md missing
cd /tmp && bash /home/benjamin/.config/.claude/lib/complexity-thresholds.sh get_complexity_thresholds
# Expected: Default values (8.0, 10, 10, 2)

# Test subdirectory override
# Create test subdirectory with custom CLAUDE.md
mkdir -p /tmp/test_project/subdir
cat > /tmp/test_project/CLAUDE.md <<'EOF'
<!-- SECTION: adaptive_planning_config -->
- **Expansion Threshold**: 8.0
<!-- END_SECTION: adaptive_planning_config -->
EOF

cat > /tmp/test_project/subdir/CLAUDE.md <<'EOF'
<!-- SECTION: adaptive_planning_config -->
- **Expansion Threshold**: 5.0
<!-- END_SECTION: adaptive_planning_config -->
EOF

cd /tmp/test_project/subdir && get_complexity_thresholds
# Expected: expansion_threshold=5.0 (subdirectory override)

# Test threshold validation
# Set invalid threshold in CLAUDE.md
sed -i 's/Expansion Threshold: 8.0/Expansion Threshold: 99.0/' CLAUDE.md
get_complexity_thresholds
# Expected: Warning logged, default 8.0 used

# Test orchestrate.md threshold integration
/orchestrate "Test feature"
# Verify: Thresholds loaded from CLAUDE.md before complexity evaluation
# Verify: "Using custom complexity thresholds" message displayed
```

### Expected Outcomes

- Threshold extraction utility working with recursive search
- Default thresholds used when CLAUDE.md not found
- Subdirectory overrides work correctly
- Threshold validation prevents invalid values
- orchestrate.md loads and passes thresholds to complexity-estimator
- Configuration documented in CLAUDE.md

## Stage 5: Inject Complexity Metadata into Plans

**Objective**: Automatically update plan files with complexity scores and expansion recommendations as inline metadata for transparency and future reference.

**Duration**: 1 hour

### Tasks

- [ ] **Design metadata injection format**
 - Add complexity metadata to each phase header:
  ```markdown
  ### Phase 2: Backend Implementation
  **Complexity**: 8.5/10 (High)
  **Expansion Status**: Recommended
  **Factors**: 15 tasks, 12 files, 3 security risks

  [Existing phase content...]
  ```
 - Add plan-level metadata section:
  ```markdown
  ## Complexity Analysis
  - **Analysis Date**: 2025-10-21
  - **Average Complexity**: 5.8/10
  - **Max Complexity**: 8.5/10 (Phase 2)
  - **Phases Requiring Expansion**: [2]
  - **Threshold Used**: 8.0 (from CLAUDE.md)

  ### Complexity Breakdown
  | Phase | Name | Score | Level | Expansion |
  |-------|------|-------|-------|-----------|
  | 1 | Setup | 3.2 | Medium | No |
  | 2 | Backend | 8.5 | High | Yes |
  | 3 | Frontend | 5.1 | Medium | No |
  ```

- [ ] **Implement metadata injection utility**
 - File: `.claude/lib/inject-complexity-metadata.sh`
 - Function: `inject_complexity_metadata(plan_path, complexity_report)`
 - Algorithm:
  1. Read complexity report YAML
  2. For each phase, find phase header in plan file
  3. Insert complexity metadata after header
  4. Add plan-level summary section after main metadata
  5. Preserve original content (don't modify tasks or descriptions)
  6. Use Edit tool for safe in-place updates

- [ ] **Add metadata update to complexity evaluation phase**
 - In orchestrate.md Phase 2.5:
  1. After complexity-estimator returns report
  2. Before displaying summary to user
  3. Invoke metadata injection utility
  4. Update plan file with complexity scores
  5. Verify update successful (check for "Complexity:" headers)

- [ ] **Handle metadata conflicts**
 - If plan already has complexity metadata (from previous run):
  - Overwrite with new values (update scenario)
  - Preserve expansion history if present
  - Add "Last Updated" timestamp
 - If plan has manual complexity notes:
  - Don't overwrite manual notes
  - Add automated metadata in separate section
  - Log warning: "Manual complexity notes detected, adding automated metadata separately"

- [ ] **Add metadata validation**
 - After injection, verify:
  - All phases have complexity metadata
  - Plan-level summary present
  - Metadata format correct (valid YAML/Markdown)
  - No duplicate metadata sections
 - If validation fails:
  - Rollback changes (restore original plan file)
  - Log error with details
  - Continue workflow without metadata injection

- [ ] **Update plan metadata with complexity analysis**
 - Add complexity metadata to plan:
  ```markdown
  ## Complexity Analysis
  - **Average Complexity**: 5.8/10
  - **Maximum Complexity**: 8.5/10 (Phase 2)
  - **Expanded Phases**: Phase 2 (Level 1 expansion due to complexity threshold)
  ```
 - Document metadata injection in plan metadata section

### Testing

```bash
# Test metadata injection on simple plan
cat > /tmp/test_plan.md <<'EOF'
## Metadata

# Test integration with orchestrate.md
/orchestrate "Test feature"
# Verify: After Phase 2.5, plan file includes complexity metadata

## Error Handling

### Malformed Plan Files

**Scenario**: Plan file missing phase headers, invalid markdown structure

**Detection**:
```bash
# Check for minimum valid structure
phase_count=$(grep -c "^### Phase [0-9]" "$plan_path")
if [[ $phase_count -eq 0 ]]; then
 echo "ERROR: No phase headers found in plan"
fi
```

**Response**:
- Return error report:
 ```yaml
 error:
  type: "malformed_plan"
  message: "Plan file does not contain valid phase headers"
  plan_path: "/path/to/plan.md"
  expected_pattern: "### Phase N: Name"
  found_headers: []
 ```
- Skip complexity analysis
- Continue workflow without expansion
- Log error for debugging

### Missing Metadata

**Scenario**: Plan missing dependency information, task checkboxes, or other expected metadata

**Detection**:
```bash
# Check for checkboxes
task_count=$(grep -c "^- \[ \]" "$plan_path")
if [[ $task_count -eq 0 ]]; then
 echo "WARNING: No task checkboxes found"
fi
```

**Response**:
- Return partial complexity report with warnings:
 ```yaml
 warnings:
  - "No task checkboxes found, task_count = 0"
  - "No dependency metadata found, dependency_depth = 0"
 phases:
  - phase_number: 1
   complexity_score: 2.1 # Based on available factors only
   missing_factors: ["task_count", "dependency_depth"]
 ```
- Calculate complexity using available factors only
- Normalize weights for missing factors
- Proceed with partial analysis

### Invalid Threshold Configuration

**Scenario**: CLAUDE.md contains invalid threshold values (negative, out of range)

**Detection**:
```bash
if [[ $(echo "$expansion_threshold > 15.0" | bc) -eq 1 ]]; then
 echo "ERROR: expansion_threshold $expansion_threshold exceeds maximum 15.0"
fi
```

**Response**:
- Log warning: "Invalid threshold configuration, using defaults"
- Fall back to hardcoded defaults (8.0, 10, 10, 2)
- Display to user: "⚠ Invalid threshold configuration detected, using defaults"
- Continue workflow with default values

### Agent Invocation Failures

**Scenario**: complexity-estimator agent fails (timeout, parsing error, exception)

**Detection**:
- Task tool returns error response
- YAML parsing of agent output fails
- Agent response doesn't match expected structure

**Response**:
- Log error with full details
- Return empty complexity report:
 ```yaml
 error: "complexity_estimator_failed"
 recommendation: "Proceed without expansion"
 ```
- Set `workflow_state.expansion_pending = false`
- Skip Phase 4 (expansion)
- Continue to Phase 5 (implementation) with original plan

### File System Errors

**Scenario**: Permission denied reading plan, disk full writing metadata

**Detection**:
```bash
if [[ ! -r "$plan_path" ]]; then
 echo "ERROR: Cannot read plan file (permission denied)"
fi
```

**Response**:
- Return error with specific file system details
- Skip affected operations (metadata injection, etc.)
- Continue workflow with degraded functionality
- Log error for system administrator review

---

## Performance Considerations

### Analysis Speed

**Target**: <5 seconds for plans up to 50 phases

**Optimization Strategies**:
- Use grep/sed for factor extraction (avoid loading entire file into memory)
- Parse plan file once, extract all factors in single pass
- Cache dependency graph computation (don't recalculate for each phase)
- Parallelize phase analysis if >10 phases (invoke multiple complexity-estimator instances)

### Memory Usage

**Target**: <100 MB memory footprint for analysis

**Optimization Strategies**:
- Stream plan file processing (don't load entire file)
- Use lightweight YAML parsing (avoid heavy libraries)
- Clear temporary data after each phase analysis
- Limit complexity report size (cap at 1000 phases)

### Caching

**Strategy**: Cache complexity reports for unchanged plans

**Implementation**:
- Generate plan hash: `md5sum plan.md`
- Store report in `.claude/data/cache/complexity/`
- Cache key: `{plan_hash}.yaml`
- Cache invalidation: Compare plan modification time vs cache time
- Cache TTL: 24 hours (refresh daily)

---

## Integration Points

### Input Dependencies

- **From Phase 2 (Planning)**: Plan file path
- **From CLAUDE.md**: Complexity threshold configuration
- **From workflow state**: Topic path, artifact paths

### Output Products

- **To Phase 4 (Expansion)**: List of phases to expand
- **To workflow state**: Complexity report, expansion recommendations
- **To plan file**: Injected complexity metadata
- **To user**: Complexity summary display

### Agent Dependencies

- **complexity-estimator**: Core analysis agent (created in Stage 2)
- **expansion-specialist**: Consumes expansion recommendations (Phase 4)
- **spec-updater**: Updates plan metadata cross-references (Phase 7)

---

---

## Notes

### Formula Tuning Process

After initial deployment, monitor complexity-estimator accuracy:

1. **Collect feedback**: Track expansion recommendations vs actual expansion needs
2. **Calculate correlation**: Compare algorithm scores vs developer judgment
3. **Identify outliers**: Find plans where algorithm significantly disagrees with humans
4. **Analyze patterns**: Look for common characteristics in outlier plans
5. **Adjust weights**: Modify formula coefficients based on patterns
6. **Re-validate**: Test updated formula against validation dataset
7. **Deploy update**: Update complexity-estimator with new weights

**Target iteration cycle**: 2-4 weeks for initial tuning, quarterly reviews thereafter

### Integration with Expansion Phase

Complexity evaluation (Phase 3) feeds directly into expansion (Phase 4):

```
Phase 3 Output:
 phases_to_expand: [2, 4]

Phase 4 Input:
 for phase in phases_to_expand:
  invoke expansion-specialist(plan_path, phase_number)
```

The expansion-specialist uses complexity scores to determine how to structure expanded phases (number of stages, level of detail, etc.).

### Threshold Customization Examples

**Research-Heavy Project** (detailed documentation preferred):
```markdown
- **Expansion Threshold**: 5.0 # More aggressive
- **Task Count Threshold**: 7
```

**Simple Web App** (larger inline phases acceptable):
```markdown
- **Expansion Threshold**: 10.0 # More conservative
- **Task Count Threshold**: 15
```

**Mission-Critical System** (maximum organization):
```markdown
- **Expansion Threshold**: 3.0 # Very aggressive
- **Task Count Threshold**: 5
```

---

## Stage 7: Calibrate Normalization Factor with Robust Scaling

**Objective**: Replace linear normalization (0.822 factor) with robust scaling to prevent score capping and improve correlation with actual complexity.

**Duration**: 2-3 hours

**Note**: This stage addresses the core calibration issues: 7/8 phases capping at 15.0, negative correlation (-0.18), and insufficient normalization factor. It implements empirical calibration using Plan 080 as validation dataset.

### Tasks

- [ ] **Create validation dataset from Plan 080**
  - File: `.claude/tests/fixtures/complexity/plan_080_ground_truth.yaml`
  - Manually assess each Phase 0-7 complexity (human judgment, 0-15 scale)
  - Rate based on actual implementation experience:
    - Phase 0: How complex was location specialist implementation?
    - Phase 1: How complex was research synthesis?
    - Phase 3: How complex was complexity evaluation? (this phase!)
  - Document rationale for each rating
  - Use as gold standard for correlation testing

- [ ] **Calculate baseline metrics with current formula**
  - Run new 5-factor analyzer (from Stage 6) on all Plan 080 phases
  - Record raw scores and normalized scores (using 0.822 factor)
  - Calculate distribution metrics:
    ```bash
    # Mean, median, std dev, IQR
    raw_scores=($(analyze_all_phases plan_080.md))
    mean=$(echo "${raw_scores[@]}" | awk '{sum+=$1} END {print sum/NR}')
    median=$(echo "${raw_scores[@]}" | sort -n | awk '{a[NR]=$1} END {print a[int(NR/2)]}')
    ```
  - Calculate correlation with ground truth:
    ```bash
    correlation=$(calculate_correlation "${raw_scores[@]}" "${ground_truth[@]}")
    echo "Baseline correlation: $correlation (target >0.90)"
    ```

- [ ] **Implement IQR-based robust scaling**
  - Create utility: `.claude/lib/robust-scaling.sh`
  - Calculate IQR from validation dataset:
    ```bash
    # Sort scores, find Q1 (25th percentile) and Q3 (75th percentile)
    Q1=$(echo "${scores[@]}" | sort -n | awk '{a[NR]=$1} END {print a[int(NR*0.25)]}')
    Q3=$(echo "${scores[@]}" | sort -n | awk '{a[NR]=$1} END {print a[int(NR*0.75)]}')
    IQR=$(echo "$Q3 - $Q1" | bc)
    median=$(calculate_median "${scores[@]}")
    ```
  - Apply robust scaling formula:
    ```bash
    # Scale using IQR instead of standard deviation
    scaled=$(echo "scale=4; ($raw_score - $median) / $IQR" | bc)
    ```
  - Store IQR and median in configuration file for reuse

- [ ] **Implement sigmoid mapping to 0-15 range**
  - Add sigmoid function to prevent ceiling effects:
    ```bash
    # Sigmoid mapping: final = 15 / (1 + e^(-scaled))
    # Uses bc's built-in exponential (e function)
    final_score=$(echo "scale=2; 15 / (1 + e(-1 * $scaled))" | bc -l)
    ```
  - Adjust sigmoid steepness parameter for optimal distribution:
    - Default steepness: 1.0 (standard sigmoid)
    - If scores cluster too tightly: increase steepness (e.g., 1.5)
    - If scores spread too widely: decrease steepness (e.g., 0.7)
  - Test sigmoid with Plan 080: verify scores distributed across full 0-15 range

- [ ] **Tune normalization for target correlation >0.90**
  - Iterative tuning process:
    1. Run robust scaling + sigmoid on Plan 080 phases
    2. Calculate correlation with ground truth
    3. If correlation <0.90: adjust feature weights or sigmoid steepness
    4. Repeat until correlation >0.90
  - Feature weight adjustment strategy:
    - If high task count phases under-scored: increase task weight (e.g., 0.30 → 0.35)
    - If security phases under-scored: increase risk weight (e.g., 0.15 → 0.20)
    - Maintain total weight = 1.00 (redistribute from other factors)
  - Document final calibrated weights in complexity formula spec

- [ ] **Verify score distribution improvements**
  - Compare before/after metrics:
    ```
    Before (linear 0.822):
      - 7/8 phases capped at 15.0
      - Correlation: -0.18
      - Score range: 14.8-15.0 (clustered)

    After (robust + sigmoid):
      - Target: 0-2 phases at 15.0 (only true extreme complexity)
      - Correlation: >0.90
      - Score range: 2.0-14.0 (distributed)
    ```
  - Calculate Coefficient of Variation (CV): CV = std/mean
  - Target CV: 15-25% (good distribution without excessive variance)

- [ ] **Update normalization in analyze-phase-complexity.sh**
  - Replace linear normalization:
    ```bash
    # OLD: normalized = raw * 0.822
    # NEW: robust scaling + sigmoid
    median=$(cat /home/benjamin/.config/.claude/data/complexity_calibration/median.txt)
    IQR=$(cat /home/benjamin/.config/.claude/data/complexity_calibration/iqr.txt)
    scaled=$(echo "scale=4; ($raw_score - $median) / $IQR" | bc)
    final_score=$(echo "scale=2; 15 / (1 + e(-1 * $scaled))" | bc -l)
    ```
  - Store calibration parameters in data directory for consistency
  - Add recalibration mechanism: if new plans show poor correlation, trigger re-tuning

- [ ] **Document calibration process and results**
  - Create report: `.claude/docs/reference/complexity-calibration-report.md`
  - Include:
    - Validation dataset description (Plan 080 ground truth)
    - Baseline metrics (before calibration)
    - Tuning iterations and adjustments made
    - Final metrics (after calibration)
    - Correlation improvement: -0.18 → target >0.90
    - Score distribution charts (text-based histograms)
    - Recommended recalibration schedule (quarterly review)

### Testing

```bash
# Test robust scaling calculation
.claude/lib/robust-scaling.sh calculate_iqr "5.2 8.1 3.4 12.5 6.7 9.3 4.8"
# Expected: Q1=4.8, Q3=9.3, IQR=4.5, median=6.7

# Test sigmoid mapping
.claude/lib/robust-scaling.sh sigmoid_map 2.5 15
# Expected: ~12.0 (positive scaled value → upper range)

.claude/lib/robust-scaling.sh sigmoid_map -2.5 15
# Expected: ~3.0 (negative scaled value → lower range)

# Test full calibration on Plan 080
.claude/tests/test_complexity_calibration.sh --run-full-calibration
# Expected output:
#   Baseline correlation: -0.18
#   After robust scaling: 0.65
#   After sigmoid + tuning: >0.90
#   Score distribution: 0-2 phases at max (15.0)

# Verify correlation improvement
correlation=$(calculate_correlation plan_080_ground_truth.yaml plan_080_calibrated_scores.yaml)
echo "Final correlation: $correlation"
# Expected: >0.90

# Test on different plan for generalization
.claude/lib/analyze-phase-complexity.sh --analyze-plan specs/plans/042_auth/042_auth.md
# Verify: Scores reasonable, no artificial capping, good distribution
```
