# Phase 3: Complexity Evaluation - Automated Plan Analysis

## Metadata
- **Phase Number**: 3
- **Phase Name**: Complexity Evaluation - Automated Plan Analysis
- **Parent Plan**: [080_orchestrate_enhancement.md](../080_orchestrate_enhancement.md)
- **Complexity Score**: 8/10
- **Expansion Reason**: Algorithmic design, multi-factor analysis, and critical role in downstream automation
- **Dependencies**: depends_on: [phase_1, phase_2]
- **Estimated Duration**: 6-8 hours
- **Risk Level**: High (algorithm accuracy affects all downstream expansion decisions)

## Objective

Implement automated complexity evaluation system that analyzes implementation plans, calculates multi-factor complexity scores, and determines which phases MUST be expanded to separate files. This system enables intelligent plan organization by identifying high-complexity phases that require detailed expansion before implementation.

## Overview

This phase creates the analytical foundation for adaptive plan organization by implementing:

1. **Weighted Complexity Formula**: Multi-factor algorithm balancing task count, file dependencies, risk factors, testing scope, and dependency chain depth
2. **complexity-estimator Agent**: Specialized agent that analyzes plan structure and returns structured complexity reports
3. **Threshold Configuration**: CLAUDE.md integration for project-specific complexity tolerances
4. **Metadata Injection**: Automatic insertion of complexity scores into plan files for transparency
5. **Expansion Triggering**: Automated decision-making for when to invoke expansion-specialist

The complexity evaluation system runs after plan creation (Phase 2) and before implementation (Phase 5), ensuring plans are optimally structured before execution begins.

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Complexity formula produces scores 0.0-15.0 with clear normalization
- [ ] complexity-estimator agent returns structured YAML reports
- [ ] Scores accurately reflect manual complexity assessment (95%+ correlation)
- [ ] Thresholds loaded from CLAUDE.md `adaptive_planning_config` section
- [ ] Plans automatically injected with complexity metadata
- [ ] Expansion recommendations trigger expansion-specialist correctly
- [ ] Error handling covers malformed plans, missing metadata, invalid YAML
- [ ] Performance: <5 seconds for plans up to 50 phases

## Architecture

### Complexity Score Components

The complexity score is a weighted combination of 5 factors:

```yaml
Components:
 task_count:
  weight: 0.30
  rationale: Task volume is primary complexity driver
  measurement: Count of checkbox items per phase

 file_references:
  weight: 0.20
  rationale: More files = more integration complexity
  measurement: Count of unique file paths in phase

 dependency_depth:
  weight: 0.20
  rationale: Complex dependency chains increase coordination overhead
  measurement: Maximum chain length from dependency graph

 test_scope:
  weight: 0.15
  rationale: Comprehensive testing adds complexity
  measurement: Count of test-related tasks and commands

 risk_factors:
  weight: 0.15
  rationale: High-risk operations require extra care
  measurement: Presence of keywords (security, migration, breaking, API)
```

**Total Weight**: 1.00 (100%)

### Normalization Strategy

Raw scores normalized to 0.0-15.0 scale:

```
normalized_score = min(15.0, raw_score * normalization_factor)

Where:
 normalization_factor = 15.0 / expected_max_raw_score
 expected_max_raw_score = (30 tasks * 0.3) + (30 files * 0.2) + (5 depth * 0.2) + (10 tests * 0.15) + (5 risks * 0.15)
             = 9.0 + 6.0 + 1.0 + 1.5 + 0.75
             = 18.25

 normalization_factor = 15.0 / 18.25 = 0.822
```

This ensures scores typically range 0.0-12.0 with extreme cases capping at 15.0.

### Threshold Configuration

Thresholds read from CLAUDE.md section:

```markdown
<!-- SECTION: adaptive_planning_config -->
## Adaptive Planning Configuration

### Complexity Thresholds

- **Expansion Threshold**: 8.0 (phases above this score → Level 1 expansion)
- **Task Count Threshold**: 10 (phases with >N tasks → expand regardless of score)
- **File Reference Threshold**: 10 (phases with >N files → increased complexity)
- **Replan Limit**: 2 (max auto-replans during /implement)
<!-- END_SECTION: adaptive_planning_config -->
```

**Configuration Priority**:
1. Project-specific CLAUDE.md (subdirectory-specific overrides)
2. Root CLAUDE.md (project defaults)
3. Hardcoded defaults (expansion: 8.0, task: 10, file: 10)

## Stage 1: Design Weighted Complexity Formula

**Objective**: Design and document the mathematical complexity formula with specific coefficients, normalization approach, and validation metrics.

**Duration**: 1-2 hours

**Note**: For current threshold values (expansion threshold, task count threshold, file reference threshold), see [CLAUDE.md adaptive_planning_config](../../../CLAUDE.md#adaptive_planning_config). This stage documents the underlying formula weights, normalization algorithm, and measurement methodology that drive those thresholds.

### Tasks

- [ ] **Document weighted formula specification**
 - Define 5 complexity factors (task_count, file_references, dependency_depth, test_scope, risk_factors)
 - Assign weights: 0.30, 0.20, 0.20, 0.15, 0.15 (totaling 1.00)
 - Document rationale for each weight assignment
 - Create formula spec document: `.claude/docs/reference/complexity-formula-spec.md`

- [ ] **Design normalization algorithm**
 - Calculate expected maximum raw score (18.25 based on typical max values)
 - Define normalization factor: 15.0 / 18.25 = 0.822
 - Implement capping at 15.0 for extreme outliers
 - Document edge cases: 0 tasks, negative values, infinity handling
 - Add examples:
  ```
  Low complexity: 3 tasks, 2 files, 0 deps, 1 test, 0 risks → Score 1.9
  Medium complexity: 8 tasks, 5 files, 1 dep, 3 tests, 1 risk → Score 5.3
  High complexity: 15 tasks, 12 files, 2 deps, 5 tests, 2 risks → Score 8.7
  Extreme complexity: 30 tasks, 25 files, 5 deps, 10 tests, 5 risks → Score 14.2
  ```

- [ ] **Define measurement methodology for each factor**
 - **task_count**: `grep -c "^- \[ \]" phase_content` (count unchecked checkboxes)
 - **file_references**: `grep -oE '(\w+/)+\w+\.\w+' | sort -u | wc -l` (unique file paths)
 - **dependency_depth**: Parse `depends_on: [...]` metadata, build graph, find max chain length
 - **test_scope**: `grep -c "test\|spec\|coverage" phase_content` (test-related keywords)
 - **risk_factors**: `grep -c "security\|migration\|breaking\|API\|database schema" phase_content` (high-risk keywords)
 - Document measurement commands in formula spec

- [ ] **Create validation dataset**
 - Manually assess complexity of 10 existing plans (from specs/plans/)
 - Rate each plan phase 1-15 based on human judgment
 - Document ground truth ratings in `.claude/tests/fixtures/complexity/ground_truth.yaml`
 - Use for correlation testing in Stage 2

- [ ] **Design coefficient tuning process**
 - Define tuning methodology: Compare algorithm scores vs ground truth
 - Calculate correlation coefficient (target >0.90)
 - Document weight adjustment procedure if correlation <0.90
 - Plan for iterative refinement based on real-world usage

### Testing

```bash
# Test formula documentation completeness
test -f /home/benjamin/.config/.claude/docs/reference/complexity-formula-spec.md
grep -q "task_count.*0.30" /home/benjamin/.config/.claude/docs/reference/complexity-formula-spec.md

# Test normalization examples
# Verify low complexity example: 3 tasks * 0.3 * 0.822 = 0.74 (base) + other factors = ~1.9
# Verify high complexity example produces score >8.0

# Test ground truth dataset
test -f /home/benjamin/.config/.claude/tests/fixtures/complexity/ground_truth.yaml
grep -q "phase_.*complexity:" /home/benjamin/.config/.claude/tests/fixtures/complexity/ground_truth.yaml
```

### Expected Outcomes

- Complete formula specification document with mathematical details
- Normalization algorithm preventing score inflation
- Measurement methodology for automated factor extraction
- Validation dataset with 10+ manually-rated plan phases
- Tuning process for weight refinement

## Stage 2: Create complexity-estimator Agent

**Objective**: Implement the complexity-estimator agent that reads plan files, applies the weighted formula, and returns structured complexity reports.

**Duration**: 2-3 hours

### Tasks

    file_reference_threshold: 10
  ```
 - Specify output format (YAML structure, see below)
 - Include error handling instructions for malformed plans

- [ ] **Implement factor extraction logic**

  ```bash
  # Extract phase content between ### Phase N: and next ### Phase or end
  # Count checkboxes: grep -c "^- \[ \]"
  # Weight: task_count * 0.3
  ```
 - **File Reference Extraction**:
  ```bash
  # Extract all file paths: grep -oE '([a-zA-Z0-9_-]+/)+[a-zA-Z0-9_-]+\.[a-zA-Z0-9]+'
  # Remove duplicates: sort -u
  # Count: wc -l
  # Weight: file_count * 0.2
  ```
 - **Dependency Depth Extraction**:
  ```bash
  # Parse dependency metadata: grep "depends_on:" phase_content
  # Build dependency graph (phase -> [dependencies])
  # Calculate max chain length using recursive traversal
  # Weight: depth * 0.2
  ```
 - **Test Scope Extraction**:
  ```bash
  # Count test-related tasks: grep -ic "test\|spec\|coverage\|testing"
  # Weight: test_count * 0.15
  ```
 - **Risk Factor Extraction**:
  ```bash
  # Count high-risk keywords: grep -ic "security\|migration\|breaking\|API\|schema\|authentication\|authorization"
  # Weight: risk_count * 0.15
  ```

- [ ] **Implement weighted formula calculation**
 - Calculate raw score: `(task * 0.3) + (files * 0.2) + (depth * 0.2) + (tests * 0.15) + (risks * 0.15)`
 - Apply normalization: `normalized = min(15.0, raw * 0.822)`
 - Round to 1 decimal place: `rounded = round(normalized, 1)`
 - Classify complexity:
  ```
  0.0-3.0: Low
  3.1-6.0: Medium
  6.1-8.0: Medium-High
  8.1-12.0: High
  12.1-15.0: Very High
  ```

- [ ] **Define structured output format**
 ```yaml
 complexity_report:
  plan_path: "/path/to/027_auth.md"
  analysis_timestamp: "2025-10-21T14:32:00Z"

   expansion_count: 2
   average_complexity: 5.8
   max_complexity: 8.5
   recommendation: "2 phases recommended for expansion before implementation"
 ```

- [ ] **Implement error handling**
 - **Malformed plan file**: Missing phase headers, invalid markdown structure
  - Detection: Check for `### Phase N:` patterns
  - Response: Return error report with specific line numbers
 - **Missing metadata**: No dependency information, no task checkboxes
  - Detection: Check for `- [ ]` patterns, `depends_on:` metadata
  - Response: Return partial report with warnings
 - **Invalid YAML dependencies**: Syntax errors in `depends_on: [...]`
  - Detection: Try parsing YAML, catch exceptions
  - Response: Skip dependency depth calculation, log warning
 - **File read errors**: Permission denied, file not found
  - Detection: Check file existence before reading
  - Response: Return error with file path and error type

- [ ] **Add agent behavioral guidelines**
 - "NEVER modify the plan file during analysis"
 - "Return only structured YAML output, no conversational text"
 - "Include all phases in report, even if complexity is 0.0"
 - "Document any assumptions made during analysis"
 - "Report warnings for ambiguous or unclear plan structure"

## Stage 3: Integrate Complexity Analysis into orchestrate.md

**Objective**: Add complexity evaluation invocation point in /orchestrate command after plan creation, extract complexity reports, and store expansion recommendations in workflow state.

**Duration**: 1-2 hours

### Tasks

- [ ] **Add Phase 2.5 to orchestrate.md workflow**
 - Insert new section after Phase 2 (Planning) completion
 - Title: "Phase 2.5: Complexity Evaluation and Expansion Analysis"

 - Example invocation:
  ```yaml
  Task:
   subagent_type: "general-purpose"
   description: "Analyze plan complexity and recommend expansion"
   prompt: |
    Read and follow the behavioral guidelines from:
    /home/benjamin/.config/.claude/agents/complexity-estimator.md

    You are acting as a Complexity Estimator Agent.

    ANALYSIS TASK: Calculate complexity scores for all phases

    Input:
     plan_path: "{plan_path_from_phase_2}"
     thresholds:
      expansion_threshold: 8.0
      task_count_threshold: 10
      file_reference_threshold: 10

  ```

MANDATORY VERIFICATION CHECKPOINT:
```bash
# Verify complexity-estimator produced valid output
if [ -z "$COMPLEXITY_ESTIMATOR_OUTPUT" ]; then
  echo "ERROR: complexity-estimator agent returned empty output"
  echo "FALLBACK: Creating minimal complexity report with conservative estimates"
  COMPLEXITY_ESTIMATOR_OUTPUT=$(cat <<'EOF'
phases:
  - phase_number: 1
    complexity_score: 5.0
    recommendation: "Manual review required"
summary:
  phases_to_expand: []
  expansion_count: 0
  average_complexity: 5.0
  max_complexity: 5.0
  recommendation: "Manual complexity analysis required - agent failed"
EOF
)
fi

# Verify output contains required fields
if ! echo "$COMPLEXITY_ESTIMATOR_OUTPUT" | grep -q "phases:"; then
  echo "ERROR: complexity-estimator output missing 'phases:' field"
  echo "FALLBACK: Using conservative fallback report"
fi

echo "Verification complete: Complexity report validated"
```
End verification. Proceed only if complexity report exists.

- [ ] **Extract complexity report from agent response**
 - Parse YAML output from complexity-estimator
 - Extract key fields:
  - `phases[]`: Array of phase complexity objects
  - `summary.phases_to_expand[]`: Array of phase numbers needing expansion
  - `summary.expansion_count`: Count of phases to expand
  - `summary.recommendation`: Human-readable summary
 - Handle parsing errors with fallback to manual expansion decision

- [ ] **Store expansion recommendations in workflow state**
 - Create workflow state object:
  ```yaml
  workflow_state:
   plan_path: "/path/to/027_auth.md"
   complexity_report:
    phases_to_expand: [2, 4]
    expansion_count: 2
    average_complexity: 5.8
    max_complexity: 8.5
   expansion_pending: true # Flag for Phase 4 (expansion)
  ```
 - Pass state to subsequent phases

- [ ] **Display complexity summary to user**
 - Format user-friendly summary:
  ```
  ✓ Phase 2.5: Complexity Evaluation Complete

  Plan Analysis: 027_auth_implementation.md
  Total Phases: 5
  Average Complexity: 5.8

  Complexity Breakdown:
   Phase 1: Setup and Configuration    | 3.2 (Medium)   | ✓ No expansion
   Phase 2: Backend Implementation    | 8.5 (High)    | ⚠ Expansion recommended
   Phase 3: Frontend Integration     | 5.1 (Medium)   | ✓ No expansion
   Phase 4: Testing and Security Review  | 7.9 (Medium-High)| ✓ No expansion
   Phase 5: Documentation and Deployment | 4.2 (Medium)   | ✓ No expansion

  Recommendation: 1 phase requires expansion before implementation
  Next: Phase 4 (Plan Expansion)
  ```
 - Use colored output if terminal supports it (green ✓, yellow ⚠)

- [ ] **Add conditional branching logic**
 - If `expansion_count > 0`:
  - Set `workflow_state.expansion_pending = true`
  - Proceed to Phase 4 (Plan Expansion with expansion-specialist)
 - If `expansion_count == 0`:
  - Set `workflow_state.expansion_pending = false`
  - Skip Phase 4, proceed directly to Phase 5 (Implementation)
  - Display: "✓ No expansion needed, proceeding to implementation"

- [ ] **Add error recovery for complexity analysis failures**
 - If complexity-estimator fails (parsing error, agent error):
  - Log warning: "Complexity analysis failed, proceeding without expansion"
  - Set `workflow_state.expansion_pending = false`
  - Continue to implementation without expansion
  - Store error details in workflow state for debugging

### Testing

```bash
# Test orchestrate.md with simple plan (no expansion needed)
/orchestrate "Fix typo in README.md"
# Verify: Phase 2.5 runs complexity-estimator
# Verify: Complexity summary displayed
# Verify: "No expansion needed" message shown
# Verify: Phase 4 skipped, proceeds to Phase 5

# Test orchestrate.md with complex plan (expansion recommended)
/orchestrate "Implement authentication with OAuth, JWT, 2FA, and session management"
# Verify: Phase 2.5 calculates high complexity scores
# Verify: Expansion summary shows "2 phases require expansion"
# Verify: workflow_state.expansion_pending = true
# Verify: Proceeds to Phase 4 (expansion-specialist invoked)

# Test error handling
# Simulate complexity-estimator failure (e.g., malformed plan)
# Verify: Error logged, workflow continues without expansion
# Verify: No crash or hang
```

### Expected Outcomes

- Phase 2.5 added to orchestrate.md workflow
- complexity-estimator invoked automatically after planning
- Complexity summary displayed to user
- Expansion recommendations stored in workflow state
- Conditional branching to expansion phase working
- Error recovery prevents workflow failure

---

## Stage 4: Implement Threshold Configuration Reading

**Objective**: Read complexity thresholds from CLAUDE.md `adaptive_planning_config` section and pass to complexity-estimator, supporting project-specific and subdirectory-specific overrides.

**Duration**: 1 hour

### Tasks

- [ ] **Create threshold extraction utility**
 - File: `.claude/lib/complexity-thresholds.sh`
 - Function: `get_complexity_thresholds()`
 - Search order:
  1. Current directory's CLAUDE.md (subdirectory-specific)
  2. Parent directories upward to project root (recursive search)
  3. Hardcoded defaults if no CLAUDE.md found
 - Extract section using markers:
  ```bash
  # Extract adaptive_planning_config section
  sed -n '/<!-- SECTION: adaptive_planning_config -->/,/<!-- END_SECTION: adaptive_planning_config -->/p' CLAUDE.md
  ```
 - Parse threshold values:
  ```bash
  # Extract expansion_threshold
  grep "Expansion Threshold:" | grep -oE '[0-9]+\.[0-9]+'

  # Extract task_count_threshold
  grep "Task Count Threshold:" | grep -oE '[0-9]+'

  # Extract file_reference_threshold
  grep "File Reference Threshold:" | grep -oE '[0-9]+'

  # Extract replan_limit
  grep "Replan Limit:" | grep -oE '[0-9]+'
  ```

- [ ] **Define default threshold values**
 - Hardcoded fallbacks when CLAUDE.md not found:
  ```yaml
  defaults:
   expansion_threshold: 8.0
   task_count_threshold: 10
   file_reference_threshold: 10
   replan_limit: 2
  ```
 - Document defaults in `.claude/docs/reference/complexity-defaults.md`

- [ ] **Implement threshold override mechanism**
 - Subdirectory CLAUDE.md overrides parent CLAUDE.md
 - Example: `nvim/CLAUDE.md` overrides root `CLAUDE.md` for nvim/ subdirectory
 - Support partial overrides (only some thresholds specified):
  ```markdown
  <!-- SECTION: adaptive_planning_config -->
  ## Adaptive Planning Configuration
  - **Expansion Threshold**: 5.0 # Override: more aggressive expansion
  <!-- Inherit other thresholds from parent CLAUDE.md -->
  <!-- END_SECTION: adaptive_planning_config -->
  ```
 - Merge parent thresholds with subdirectory thresholds (subdirectory wins)

- [ ] **Integrate threshold loading into orchestrate.md**
 - Before Phase 2.5 (complexity evaluation):
  - Invoke threshold extraction utility
  - Load thresholds based on plan location
  - Store in workflow state
 - Pass thresholds to complexity-estimator agent:
  ```yaml
  complexity_estimator_input:
   thresholds:
    expansion_threshold: 8.0 # From CLAUDE.md
    task_count_threshold: 10
    file_reference_threshold: 10
  ```

- [ ] **Add threshold validation**
 - Validate extracted thresholds:
  - `expansion_threshold`: 0.0 ≤ value ≤ 15.0
  - `task_count_threshold`: 1 ≤ value ≤ 50
  - `file_reference_threshold`: 1 ≤ value ≤ 100
  - `replan_limit`: 1 ≤ value ≤ 5
 - If invalid, log warning and use defaults
 - Display to user: "Using custom complexity thresholds from CLAUDE.md"

- [ ] **Document threshold configuration in CLAUDE.md**
 - Update root CLAUDE.md with threshold configuration section
 - Add examples for different project types:
  - Research-heavy (aggressive expansion): threshold 5.0
  - Simple web app (conservative expansion): threshold 10.0
  - Mission-critical (maximum organization): threshold 3.0
 - Link to complexity formula spec for details

### Testing

```bash
# Test threshold extraction from CLAUDE.md
bash .claude/lib/complexity-thresholds.sh get_complexity_thresholds
# Expected: expansion_threshold=8.0, task_count_threshold=10, ...

# Test default fallback when CLAUDE.md missing
cd /tmp && bash /home/benjamin/.config/.claude/lib/complexity-thresholds.sh get_complexity_thresholds
# Expected: Default values (8.0, 10, 10, 2)

# Test subdirectory override
# Create test subdirectory with custom CLAUDE.md
mkdir -p /tmp/test_project/subdir
cat > /tmp/test_project/CLAUDE.md <<'EOF'
<!-- SECTION: adaptive_planning_config -->
- **Expansion Threshold**: 8.0
<!-- END_SECTION: adaptive_planning_config -->
EOF

cat > /tmp/test_project/subdir/CLAUDE.md <<'EOF'
<!-- SECTION: adaptive_planning_config -->
- **Expansion Threshold**: 5.0
<!-- END_SECTION: adaptive_planning_config -->
EOF

cd /tmp/test_project/subdir && get_complexity_thresholds
# Expected: expansion_threshold=5.0 (subdirectory override)

# Test threshold validation
# Set invalid threshold in CLAUDE.md
sed -i 's/Expansion Threshold: 8.0/Expansion Threshold: 99.0/' CLAUDE.md
get_complexity_thresholds
# Expected: Warning logged, default 8.0 used

# Test orchestrate.md threshold integration
/orchestrate "Test feature"
# Verify: Thresholds loaded from CLAUDE.md before complexity evaluation
# Verify: "Using custom complexity thresholds" message displayed
```

### Expected Outcomes

- Threshold extraction utility working with recursive search
- Default thresholds used when CLAUDE.md not found
- Subdirectory overrides work correctly
- Threshold validation prevents invalid values
- orchestrate.md loads and passes thresholds to complexity-estimator
- Configuration documented in CLAUDE.md

## Stage 5: Inject Complexity Metadata into Plans

**Objective**: Automatically update plan files with complexity scores and expansion recommendations as inline metadata for transparency and future reference.

**Duration**: 1 hour

### Tasks

- [ ] **Design metadata injection format**
 - Add complexity metadata to each phase header:
  ```markdown
  ### Phase 2: Backend Implementation
  **Complexity**: 8.5/10 (High)
  **Expansion Status**: Recommended
  **Factors**: 15 tasks, 12 files, 3 security risks

  [Existing phase content...]
  ```
 - Add plan-level metadata section:
  ```markdown
  ## Complexity Analysis
  - **Analysis Date**: 2025-10-21
  - **Average Complexity**: 5.8/10
  - **Max Complexity**: 8.5/10 (Phase 2)
  - **Phases Requiring Expansion**: [2]
  - **Threshold Used**: 8.0 (from CLAUDE.md)

  ### Complexity Breakdown
  | Phase | Name | Score | Level | Expansion |
  |-------|------|-------|-------|-----------|
  | 1 | Setup | 3.2 | Medium | No |
  | 2 | Backend | 8.5 | High | Yes |
  | 3 | Frontend | 5.1 | Medium | No |
  ```

- [ ] **Implement metadata injection utility**
 - File: `.claude/lib/inject-complexity-metadata.sh`
 - Function: `inject_complexity_metadata(plan_path, complexity_report)`
 - Algorithm:
  1. Read complexity report YAML
  2. For each phase, find phase header in plan file
  3. Insert complexity metadata after header
  4. Add plan-level summary section after main metadata
  5. Preserve original content (don't modify tasks or descriptions)
  6. Use Edit tool for safe in-place updates

- [ ] **Add metadata update to complexity evaluation phase**
 - In orchestrate.md Phase 2.5:
  1. After complexity-estimator returns report
  2. Before displaying summary to user
  3. Invoke metadata injection utility
  4. Update plan file with complexity scores
  5. Verify update successful (check for "Complexity:" headers)

- [ ] **Handle metadata conflicts**
 - If plan already has complexity metadata (from previous run):
  - Overwrite with new values (update scenario)
  - Preserve expansion history if present
  - Add "Last Updated" timestamp
 - If plan has manual complexity notes:
  - Don't overwrite manual notes
  - Add automated metadata in separate section
  - Log warning: "Manual complexity notes detected, adding automated metadata separately"

- [ ] **Add metadata validation**
 - After injection, verify:
  - All phases have complexity metadata
  - Plan-level summary present
  - Metadata format correct (valid YAML/Markdown)
  - No duplicate metadata sections
 - If validation fails:
  - Rollback changes (restore original plan file)
  - Log error with details
  - Continue workflow without metadata injection

- [ ] **Update plan metadata with complexity analysis**
 - Add complexity metadata to plan:
  ```markdown
  ## Complexity Analysis
  - **Average Complexity**: 5.8/10
  - **Maximum Complexity**: 8.5/10 (Phase 2)
  - **Expanded Phases**: Phase 2 (Level 1 expansion due to complexity threshold)
  ```
 - Document metadata injection in plan metadata section

### Testing

```bash
# Test metadata injection on simple plan
cat > /tmp/test_plan.md <<'EOF'
## Metadata

## Error Handling

### Malformed Plan Files

**Scenario**: Plan file missing phase headers, invalid markdown structure

**Detection**:
```bash
# Check for minimum valid structure
phase_count=$(grep -c "^### Phase [0-9]" "$plan_path")
if [[ $phase_count -eq 0 ]]; then
 echo "ERROR: No phase headers found in plan"
fi
```

**Response**:
- Return error report:
 ```yaml
 error:
  type: "malformed_plan"
  message: "Plan file does not contain valid phase headers"
  plan_path: "/path/to/plan.md"
  expected_pattern: "### Phase N: Name"
  found_headers: []
 ```
- Skip complexity analysis
- Continue workflow without expansion
- Log error for debugging

### Missing Metadata

**Scenario**: Plan missing dependency information, task checkboxes, or other expected metadata

**Detection**:
```bash
# Check for checkboxes
task_count=$(grep -c "^- \[ \]" "$plan_path")
if [[ $task_count -eq 0 ]]; then
 echo "WARNING: No task checkboxes found"
fi
```

**Response**:
- Return partial complexity report with warnings:
 ```yaml
 warnings:
  - "No task checkboxes found, task_count = 0"
  - "No dependency metadata found, dependency_depth = 0"
 phases:
  - phase_number: 1
   complexity_score: 2.1 # Based on available factors only
   missing_factors: ["task_count", "dependency_depth"]
 ```
- Calculate complexity using available factors only
- Normalize weights for missing factors
- Proceed with partial analysis

### Invalid Threshold Configuration

**Scenario**: CLAUDE.md contains invalid threshold values (negative, out of range)

**Detection**:
```bash
if [[ $(echo "$expansion_threshold > 15.0" | bc) -eq 1 ]]; then
 echo "ERROR: expansion_threshold $expansion_threshold exceeds maximum 15.0"
fi
```

**Response**:
- Log warning: "Invalid threshold configuration, using defaults"
- Fall back to hardcoded defaults (8.0, 10, 10, 2)
- Display to user: "⚠ Invalid threshold configuration detected, using defaults"
- Continue workflow with default values

### Agent Invocation Failures

**Scenario**: complexity-estimator agent fails (timeout, parsing error, exception)

**Detection**:
- Task tool returns error response
- YAML parsing of agent output fails
- Agent response doesn't match expected structure

**Response**:
- Log error with full details
- Return empty complexity report:
 ```yaml
 error: "complexity_estimator_failed"
 recommendation: "Proceed without expansion"
 ```
- Set `workflow_state.expansion_pending = false`
- Skip Phase 4 (expansion)
- Continue to Phase 5 (implementation) with original plan

### File System Errors

**Scenario**: Permission denied reading plan, disk full writing metadata

**Detection**:
```bash
if [[ ! -r "$plan_path" ]]; then
 echo "ERROR: Cannot read plan file (permission denied)"
fi
```

**Response**:
- Return error with specific file system details
- Skip affected operations (metadata injection, etc.)
- Continue workflow with degraded functionality
- Log error for system administrator review

---

## Performance Considerations

### Analysis Speed

**Target**: <5 seconds for plans up to 50 phases

**Optimization Strategies**:
- Use grep/sed for factor extraction (avoid loading entire file into memory)
- Parse plan file once, extract all factors in single pass
- Cache dependency graph computation (don't recalculate for each phase)
- Parallelize phase analysis if >10 phases (invoke multiple complexity-estimator instances)

### Memory Usage

**Target**: <100 MB memory footprint for analysis

**Optimization Strategies**:
- Stream plan file processing (don't load entire file)
- Use lightweight YAML parsing (avoid heavy libraries)
- Clear temporary data after each phase analysis
- Limit complexity report size (cap at 1000 phases)

### Caching

**Strategy**: Cache complexity reports for unchanged plans

**Implementation**:
- Generate plan hash: `md5sum plan.md`
- Store report in `.claude/data/cache/complexity/`
- Cache key: `{plan_hash}.yaml`
- Cache invalidation: Compare plan modification time vs cache time
- Cache TTL: 24 hours (refresh daily)

---

## Integration Points

### Input Dependencies

- **From Phase 2 (Planning)**: Plan file path
- **From CLAUDE.md**: Complexity threshold configuration
- **From workflow state**: Topic path, artifact paths

### Output Products

- **To Phase 4 (Expansion)**: List of phases to expand
- **To workflow state**: Complexity report, expansion recommendations
- **To plan file**: Injected complexity metadata
- **To user**: Complexity summary display

### Agent Dependencies

- **complexity-estimator**: Core analysis agent (created in Stage 2)
- **expansion-specialist**: Consumes expansion recommendations (Phase 4)
- **spec-updater**: Updates plan metadata cross-references (Phase 7)

---

---

## Notes

### Formula Tuning Process

After initial deployment, monitor complexity-estimator accuracy:

1. **Collect feedback**: Track expansion recommendations vs actual expansion needs
2. **Calculate correlation**: Compare algorithm scores vs developer judgment
3. **Identify outliers**: Find plans where algorithm significantly disagrees with humans
4. **Analyze patterns**: Look for common characteristics in outlier plans
5. **Adjust weights**: Modify formula coefficients based on patterns
6. **Re-validate**: Test updated formula against validation dataset
7. **Deploy update**: Update complexity-estimator with new weights

**Target iteration cycle**: 2-4 weeks for initial tuning, quarterly reviews thereafter

### Integration with Expansion Phase

Complexity evaluation (Phase 3) feeds directly into expansion (Phase 4):

```
Phase 3 Output:
 phases_to_expand: [2, 4]

Phase 4 Input:
 for phase in phases_to_expand:
  invoke expansion-specialist(plan_path, phase_number)
```

The expansion-specialist uses complexity scores to determine how to structure expanded phases (number of stages, level of detail, etc.).

### Threshold Customization Examples

**Research-Heavy Project** (detailed documentation preferred):
```markdown
- **Expansion Threshold**: 5.0 # More aggressive
- **Task Count Threshold**: 7
```

**Simple Web App** (larger inline phases acceptable):
```markdown
- **Expansion Threshold**: 10.0 # More conservative
- **Task Count Threshold**: 15
```

**Mission-Critical System** (maximum organization):
```markdown
- **Expansion Threshold**: 3.0 # Very aggressive
- **Task Count Threshold**: 5
```

- ✅ Weighted formula calculation using integer arithmetic (no bc dependency)
- ✅ Debug logging available via `COMPLEXITY_DEBUG=1` environment variable

## Stage 7: Calibrate Normalization Factor with Robust Scaling [COMPLETED]

**Status**: COMPLETED ✓ (2025-10-21)
**Commit**: Pending
**Objective**: Replace linear normalization (0.822 factor) with robust scaling to prevent score capping and improve correlation with actual complexity.

**Duration**: 2-3 hours (Actual: ~2 hours)

**Note**: This stage addressed the core calibration issues. Discovered that original report of "7/8 phases capping at 15.0" was based on collapsed parent plan analysis. After fixing to analyze expanded phase files, calibration improved correlation from 0.0869 to 0.7515 (below 0.90 target but substantial improvement). Normalization factor adjusted from 0.822 to 0.411.

### Tasks

- [x] **Create validation dataset from Plan 080**
  - File: `.claude/tests/fixtures/complexity/plan_080_ground_truth.yaml`
  - Manually assess each Phase 0-7 complexity (human judgment, 0-15 scale)
  - Rate based on actual implementation experience:
    - Phase 0: How complex was location specialist implementation?
    - Phase 1: How complex was research synthesis?
    - Phase 3: How complex was complexity evaluation? (this phase!)
  - Document rationale for each rating
  - Use as gold standard for correlation testing

- [x] **Calculate baseline metrics with current formula**
  - ✅ Created test_complexity_baseline.py script
  - ✅ Discovered critical issue: parent plan analysis found 0 tasks for collapsed phases
  - ✅ Created test_complexity_calibration_v2.py to analyze expanded phase files
  - ✅ Baseline correlation improved from 0.0869 to 0.7058 with correct file analysis
  - ✅ Distribution metrics calculated: raw scores 1.4-42.7, mean 28.26

- [x] **Implement IQR-based robust scaling**
  - Create utility: `.claude/lib/robust-scaling.sh`
  - Calculate IQR from validation dataset:
    ```bash
    # Sort scores, find Q1 (25th percentile) and Q3 (75th percentile)
    Q1=$(echo "${scores[@]}" | sort -n | awk '{a[NR]=$1} END {print a[int(NR*0.25)]}')
    Q3=$(echo "${scores[@]}" | sort -n | awk '{a[NR]=$1} END {print a[int(NR*0.75)]}')
    IQR=$(echo "$Q3 - $Q1" | bc)
    median=$(calculate_median "${scores[@]}")
    ```
  - Apply robust scaling formula:
    ```bash
    # Scale using IQR instead of standard deviation
    scaled=$(echo "scale=4; ($raw_score - $median) / $IQR" | bc)
    ```
  - Store IQR and median in configuration file for reuse

- [x] **Implement sigmoid mapping to 0-15 range**
  - ✅ Created robust-scaling.sh with sigmoid_map function
  - ✅ Tested sigmoid with positive/negative scaled values
  - ✅ Note: Sigmoid was prepared but linear scaling performed better in grid search
  - ✅ Linear scaling chosen as best approach (correlation 0.7515 vs sigmoid 0.7481)

- [x] **Tune normalization for target correlation >0.90**
  - ✅ Grid search performed for linear, power law, and robust sigmoid scaling
  - ✅ Best result: Linear scaling with factor 0.500 (correlation 0.7515)
  - ✅ Target not achieved (0.7515 < 0.90) but substantial improvement from 0.0869
  - ✅ Root causes identified: Phase 2 collapsed, ceiling effects, factor caps
  - ✅ Recommendations documented for achieving >0.90 in future iterations

- [x] **Verify score distribution improvements**
  - ✅ Actual improvement verified:
    ```
    Before (0.822, parent plan):
      - Correlation: 0.0869 (near-zero, severe under-scoring)
      - Mean score: 1.26
      - Range: 0.5-3.9

    After (0.411, expanded files):
      - Correlation: 0.7515 (good, below target)
      - Mean score: 10.23
      - Range: 0.7-15.0
      - 3/8 phases at ceiling (38%, down from expected 88%)
    ```
  - ✅ Distribution significantly improved: CV increased from 88% to 45%
  - ✅ Note: Original "7/8 at 15.0" was artifact of collapsed plan analysis

- [x] **Update normalization in analyze-phase-complexity.sh**

# Expected: Q1=4.8, Q3=9.3, IQR=4.5, median=6.7

# Test sigmoid mapping
.claude/lib/robust-scaling.sh sigmoid_map 2.5 15
# Expected: ~12.0 (positive scaled value → upper range)

.claude/lib/robust-scaling.sh sigmoid_map -2.5 15
# Expected: ~3.0 (negative scaled value → lower range)

# Test full calibration on Plan 080
.claude/tests/test_complexity_calibration.sh --run-full-calibration
# Expected output:
#   Baseline correlation: -0.18
#   After robust scaling: 0.65
#   After sigmoid + tuning: >0.90
#   Score distribution: 0-2 phases at max (15.0)

# Verify correlation improvement
correlation=$(calculate_correlation plan_080_ground_truth.yaml plan_080_calibrated_scores.yaml)
echo "Final correlation: $correlation"
# Expected: >0.90

# Test on different plan for generalization
.claude/lib/analyze-phase-complexity.sh --analyze-plan specs/plans/042_auth/042_auth.md
# Verify: Scores reasonable, no artificial capping, good distribution
```

### Expected Outcomes [ACHIEVED]

- ✅ Validation dataset created from Plan 080 with manual complexity ratings (plan_080_ground_truth.yaml)
- ✅ Baseline metrics calculated revealing parent plan vs expanded file issue
- ✅ IQR-based robust scaling implemented in robust-scaling.sh
- ✅ Sigmoid mapping prepared (linear scaling chosen as superior)
- ⚠️ Correlation improved from 0.0869 to 0.7515 (target >0.90 not achieved, see limitations)
- ✅ Score distribution significantly improved: mean 1.26 → 10.23, range 0.5-3.9 → 0.7-15.0
- ✅ Normalization factor tuned: 0.822 → 0.411 (empirically calibrated)
- ✅ Calibration process fully documented in complexity-calibration-report.md
- ✅ Recommendations provided for achieving >0.90 in future iterations

### Implementation Summary

**What Worked**:
1. Ground truth dataset provided objective calibration target
2. Expanded file analysis fixed severe under-scoring (correlation 0.09 → 0.71)
3. Grid search efficiently found optimal normalization factor (0.411)
4. Comprehensive documentation enables future improvements

**Limitations Discovered**:
1. Phase 2 collapsed (not expanded) causes -4.3 point error
2. Ceiling effects: 3/8 phases at 15.0 maximum
3. Factor caps (files=30, tests=20) reduce discrimination
4. Task count dominates scoring for 100+ task phases

**Path to 0.90 Correlation**:
1. Expand Phase 2 to separate file: +0.10 correlation (estimated)
2. Adjust factor caps and task scaling: +0.05 correlation
3. Re-tune with improvements: potential 0.90+ correlation

**Deliverables**:
- Ground truth dataset: plan_080_ground_truth.yaml
- Baseline script: test_complexity_baseline.py
- Calibration script: test_complexity_calibration_v2.py
- Robust scaling utility: robust-scaling.sh
- Calibration report: complexity-calibration-report.md
- Updated analyzer: analyze-phase-complexity.sh (factor 0.411)
