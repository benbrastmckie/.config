| 4 | Authentication System Migration | 20 | 12 | HIGH | 9-10 | YES |
| 5 | Parallel Execution Orchestration | 32+ | 20+ | V.HIGH | 12+ | YES |

## Output Format Specification

### Expected YAML Structure

The complexity-estimator agent produces the following YAML structure per the agent specification (complexity-estimator.md):

```yaml
complexity_assessment:
  phase_name: "Phase Name"
  complexity_score: N  # Integer 0-15
  confidence: "high" | "medium" | "low"

  reasoning: |
    Multi-line explanation of complexity assessment.
    References comparable calibration example.
    Explains key factors and adjustments.

  key_factors:
    - "Factor 1 description"
    - "Factor 2 description"
    - "Factor 3 description"
    # ... 3-6 factors

  comparable_to: "Calibration Example Name (Score)"

  expansion_recommended: true | false
  expansion_reason: "Explanation of why expansion is/isn't recommended"

  edge_cases_detected: []  # Array of edge case strings
```

### Required Fields for Phase 4

The expansion-specialist agent (Phase 4) requires the following fields from complexity-estimator output:

**CRITICAL (Must Have)**:
- `phase_name`: Identifies which phase was assessed
- `complexity_score`: Numeric score (0-15) for expansion decision
- `expansion_recommended`: Boolean flag for expansion trigger

**OPTIONAL (For Documentation)**:
- `reasoning`: Natural language explanation (for expansion rationale documentation)
- `key_factors`: List of complexity drivers (for expansion documentation)
- `confidence`: Assessment confidence (for quality tracking)
- `edge_cases_detected`: Special conditions (for handling edge cases)

**NOT NEEDED by Phase 4**:
- `comparable_to`: Only used for transparency in agent reasoning

## Invocation Pattern

### Individual Per-Phase Assessment (RECOMMENDED)

orchestrate.md Phase 2.5 MUST invoke complexity-estimator once per phase:

```bash
# Phase 2.5: Complexity Evaluation in orchestrate.md

PLAN_PATH="specs/027_auth/plans/027_auth_implementation.md"
PHASE_COUNT=$(grep -c "^### Phase" "$PLAN_PATH")

# Initialize assessment storage
declare -a COMPLEXITY_ASSESSMENTS
HIGH_COMPLEXITY_PHASES=()

# Assess each phase individually
for PHASE_NUM in $(seq 1 $PHASE_COUNT); do
  # Extract phase content
  PHASE_CONTENT=$(sed -n "/^### Phase $PHASE_NUM:/,/^### Phase $((PHASE_NUM+1)):/p" "$PLAN_PATH")
  PHASE_NAME=$(echo "$PHASE_CONTENT" | head -1 | sed 's/^### Phase [0-9]*: //')

  # Invoke complexity-estimator agent via Task tool
  echo "Assessing Phase $PHASE_NUM: $PHASE_NAME"

  ASSESSMENT=$(claude-code Task <<EOF
subagent_type: general-purpose
description: "Assess complexity of Phase $PHASE_NUM"
prompt: |
  You are invoking the complexity-estimator agent. Read the agent specification at .claude/agents/complexity-estimator.md and follow it exactly.

  Assess the following phase from plan $PLAN_PATH:

  operation: assess_phase_complexity

  phase_name: "$PHASE_NAME"
  phase_content: |
$PHASE_CONTENT

  is_expanded: false

  plan_context:
    plan_name: "Authentication Implementation"
    plan_overview: "Implement OAuth2 authentication system"
    total_phases: $PHASE_COUNT

  thresholds:
    expansion_threshold: 8.0

  Return ONLY the YAML output as specified in the agent's Output Format section.
EOF
)

  # Store assessment
  COMPLEXITY_ASSESSMENTS[$PHASE_NUM]="$ASSESSMENT"

  # Extract complexity score and expansion recommendation
  COMPLEXITY_SCORE=$(echo "$ASSESSMENT" | grep "complexity_score:" | awk '{print $2}')
  EXPANSION_REC=$(echo "$ASSESSMENT" | grep "expansion_recommended:" | awk '{print $2}')

  # Collect high-complexity phases
  if [ "$EXPANSION_REC" = "true" ]; then
    HIGH_COMPLEXITY_PHASES+=("Phase $PHASE_NUM: $PHASE_NAME")
  fi

  echo "Phase $PHASE_NUM assessment complete: Score $COMPLEXITY_SCORE, Expand: $EXPANSION_REC"
done

# Verification checkpoint (see Section below)
verify_complexity_assessments
```

### Batch Multi-Phase Assessment (NOT RECOMMENDED)

Alternatively, complexity-estimator could be modified to accept batch input:

```yaml
operation: assess_plan_complexity

plan_path: "specs/027_auth/plans/027_auth_implementation.md"
phases:
  - phase_name: "Phase 1: ..."
    phase_content: |
      [content]
  - phase_name: "Phase 2: ..."
    phase_content: |
      [content]

thresholds:
  expansion_threshold: 8.0
```

**Output**:
```yaml
complexity_assessments:
  - complexity_assessment:
      phase_name: "Phase 1: ..."
      complexity_score: 5
      # ...
  - complexity_assessment:
      phase_name: "Phase 2: ..."
      complexity_score: 9
      # ...
```

**Why NOT Recommended**:
- Increases agent complexity (must handle array of phases)
- Harder to isolate errors (one bad phase fails entire batch)
- Inconsistent with research phase pattern (individual parallel agents)
- More difficult to test and validate

## Verification Checkpoint

orchestrate.md Phase 2.5 MUST include verification checkpoint:

```bash
# MANDATORY VERIFICATION: Complexity Evaluation Complete

verify_complexity_assessments() {
  echo "Verifying complexity assessments..."

  # 1. Count phases in plan
  EXPECTED_COUNT=$PHASE_COUNT
  ACTUAL_COUNT=${#COMPLEXITY_ASSESSMENTS[@]}

  if [ "$ACTUAL_COUNT" -ne "$EXPECTED_COUNT" ]; then
    echo "ERROR: Phase count mismatch (expected $EXPECTED_COUNT, got $ACTUAL_COUNT)"
    execute_fallback
    return 1
  fi

  # 2. Validate YAML structure for each assessment
  for PHASE_NUM in $(seq 1 $PHASE_COUNT); do
    ASSESSMENT="${COMPLEXITY_ASSESSMENTS[$PHASE_NUM]}"

    # Check required fields present
    echo "$ASSESSMENT" | grep -q "phase_name:" || { echo "ERROR: phase_name missing in Phase $PHASE_NUM"; execute_fallback; return 1; }
    echo "$ASSESSMENT" | grep -q "complexity_score:" || { echo "ERROR: complexity_score missing in Phase $PHASE_NUM"; execute_fallback; return 1; }
    echo "$ASSESSMENT" | grep -q "expansion_recommended:" || { echo "ERROR: expansion_recommended missing in Phase $PHASE_NUM"; execute_fallback; return 1; }

    # Validate complexity score is numeric and in range
    SCORE=$(echo "$ASSESSMENT" | grep "complexity_score:" | awk '{print $2}')
    if ! [[ "$SCORE" =~ ^[0-9]+$ ]] || [ "$SCORE" -lt 0 ] || [ "$SCORE" -gt 15 ]; then
      echo "ERROR: Invalid complexity score ($SCORE) in Phase $PHASE_NUM"
      execute_fallback
      return 1
    fi
  done

  # 3. Verify at least one phase has non-default score
  ALL_DEFAULT=true
  for PHASE_NUM in $(seq 1 $PHASE_COUNT); do
    SCORE=$(echo "${COMPLEXITY_ASSESSMENTS[$PHASE_NUM]}" | grep "complexity_score:" | awk '{print $2}')
    if [ "$SCORE" -ne 5 ]; then
      ALL_DEFAULT=false
      break
    fi
  done

  if [ "$ALL_DEFAULT" = "true" ]; then
    echo "WARNING: All phases have default score (5), assessments may be degraded"
    # Continue anyway, this is not critical
  fi

  echo "Verification complete: All assessments valid"
  return 0
}

execute_fallback() {
  echo "FALLBACK: Complexity evaluation failed, using degraded mode"

  # Fallback strategy: Use task count heuristic only
  HIGH_COMPLEXITY_PHASES=()

  for PHASE_NUM in $(seq 1 $PHASE_COUNT); do
    PHASE_CONTENT=$(sed -n "/^### Phase $PHASE_NUM:/,/^### Phase $((PHASE_NUM+1)):/p" "$PLAN_PATH")
    TASK_COUNT=$(echo "$PHASE_CONTENT" | grep -c "^- \[ \]")

    if [ "$TASK_COUNT" -gt 10 ]; then
      PHASE_NAME=$(echo "$PHASE_CONTENT" | head -1 | sed 's/^### Phase [0-9]*: //')
      HIGH_COMPLEXITY_PHASES+=("Phase $PHASE_NUM: $PHASE_NAME")
      echo "Fallback: Phase $PHASE_NUM marked for expansion (task count: $TASK_COUNT > 10)"
    fi
  done

  echo "Fallback complete: Identified ${#HIGH_COMPLEXITY_PHASES[@]} high-complexity phases"
}
```

## Expansion Recommendation Logic

The expansion-specialist (Phase 4) uses the following logic:

```bash
# After receiving complexity assessment
COMPLEXITY_SCORE=$(echo "$ASSESSMENT" | grep "complexity_score:" | awk '{print $2}')
EXPANSION_REC=$(echo "$ASSESSMENT" | grep "expansion_recommended:" | awk '{print $2}')
EXPANSION_THRESHOLD=8.0  # From CLAUDE.md adaptive_planning_config

# Decision logic
if [ "$EXPANSION_REC" = "true" ]; then
  echo "Expansion recommended by complexity-estimator (score: $COMPLEXITY_SCORE > $EXPANSION_THRESHOLD)"
  invoke_expansion_specialist "$PHASE_NUM" "$PLAN_PATH"
elif [ "$COMPLEXITY_SCORE" -gt "$(echo "$EXPANSION_THRESHOLD" | cut -d. -f1)" ]; then
  echo "Expansion triggered by score threshold (score: $COMPLEXITY_SCORE > $EXPANSION_THRESHOLD)"
  invoke_expansion_specialist "$PHASE_NUM" "$PLAN_PATH"
else
  echo "No expansion needed (score: $COMPLEXITY_SCORE ≤ $EXPANSION_THRESHOLD)"
fi
```

**Note**: The agent's `expansion_recommended` field should already implement this logic internally, so the second condition is redundant. However, including it provides defense-in-depth if the agent malfunctions.

## Performance Testing

### Expected Performance Targets

From complexity-estimator.md:

- **Single phase assessment**: <3 seconds per phase
- **Consistency**: Multiple runs on same phase within ±0.5 points
- **Correlation with ground truth**: >0.90 (achieved: 1.0000 perfect)

### Actual Performance (from Phase 3 validation)

From Phase 3 Stage 7 agent validation:

- **Assessment time**: ~2-3 seconds per phase (meets target)
- **Consistency**: σ = 0.00 (perfect determinism, exceeds ±0.5 target)
- **Correlation**: 1.0000 (perfect, exceeds 0.90 target)

**Performance validated** ✓

## Phase 4 Integration Requirements

### Input to expansion-specialist

The expansion-specialist agent (Phase 4 Stage 1) will receive:

```yaml
operation: expand_phase

phase_number: N
phase_name: "Phase Name"
plan_path: "specs/027_auth/plans/027_auth_implementation.md"

complexity_assessment:
  complexity_score: 10
  expansion_recommended: true
  reasoning: "..."
  key_factors: [...]

thresholds:
  expansion_threshold: 8.0
  task_count_threshold: 10

context:
  topic_path: "specs/027_auth/"
  topic_number: "027"
```

**Required fields from complexity-estimator**:
- `complexity_score`: For documentation
- `expansion_recommended`: Already calculated
- `reasoning`: For expansion rationale documentation
- `key_factors`: For expansion documentation

### Output from expansion-specialist

The expansion-specialist MUST produce:

1. **Expanded phase file**: `specs/027_auth/plans/027_auth_implementation/phase_N_name.md`
2. **Updated parent plan**: Summary + reference link in Level 0 plan
3. **Metadata update**: Expansion history in plan metadata

## Validation Results

### Test Plan Validation

✅ **Test plan created**: `.claude/tests/fixtures/complexity/test_multi_phase_plan.md`
- 5 phases with complexity range: 2-3 to 12+
- 78 total tasks across phases
- Covers LOW, MEDIUM, MEDIUM-HIGH, HIGH, VERY HIGH complexity

✅ **Expected scores documented**: Each phase has expected complexity range
✅ **Expansion logic testable**: Phases 4-5 should trigger expansion (>8.0)
✅ **Edge cases included**: Phase 3 is borderline (7-8 ≤ 8.0)

### Output Format Validation

| Validation Item | Status | Notes |
|----------------|--------|-------|
| Test plan with 5 phases | ✅ | test_multi_phase_plan.md created |
| YAML output format validated | ✅ | Matches complexity-estimator.md spec |
| Invocation pattern documented | ✅ | Individual per-phase recommended |

## Recommendations for Phase 4 Stage 0

When implementing orchestrate.md Phase 2.5:

1. **Use individual per-phase invocation**: More robust, easier to debug
2. **Implement verification checkpoint**: Critical for catching agent failures
3. **Include fallback mechanism**: Degrade gracefully to task count heuristic
4. **Log all assessments**: Useful for debugging and performance tracking
5. **Pass full complexity_assessment to Phase 2.6**: expansion-specialist needs reasoning/key_factors for documentation

## Files Created

1. `.claude/tests/fixtures/complexity/test_multi_phase_plan.md` (test plan, 78 tasks)
2. `.claude/specs/plans/080_orchestrate_enhancement/reports/phase_3_4_stage_2_validation_report.md` (this report)

## Next Steps

Phase 4 Stage 0 can now proceed with confidence that:
- complexity-estimator output format is well-defined
- Invocation pattern is documented and validated
- Verification and fallback mechanisms are specified
- Phase 4 integration requirements are clear

**Stage 2 validation complete** ✓
