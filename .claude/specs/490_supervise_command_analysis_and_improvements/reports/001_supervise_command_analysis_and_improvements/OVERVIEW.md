## Executive Summary

The /supervise command is a well-architected multi-agent workflow orchestrator that correctly implements behavioral injection patterns but lacks wave-based parallel execution and has 95% functional overlap with /orchestrate. Analysis reveals three categories of findings: (1) architectural gaps requiring sequential implementation upgrade to parallel waves (40-60% potential time savings), (2) minor standards violations involving behavioral content duplication and missing imperative markers (3 specific instances), and (3) historical delegation failure anti-pattern already resolved as of October 2024. The primary strategic recommendation is to deprecate /supervise in favor of /orchestrate due to high functional redundancy, superior performance characteristics, and reduced maintenance burden, with a gradual migration plan to minimize user disruption.

## Research Structure

This overview synthesizes findings from 4 individual research reports:

1. **[/supervise Command Implementation Analysis](./001_supervise_command_implementation_analysis.md)** - Comprehensive analysis of current implementation structure, Phase 3 sequential execution gap, and comparison with /orchestrate's wave-based parallel pattern
2. **[Standards Violations and Pattern Deviations](./002_standards_violations_and_pattern_deviations.md)** - Identification of three specific violations: behavioral content duplication (250 lines), missing imperative markers (2 instances), and code-fenced anti-pattern risk
3. **[Root Cause of Subagent Delegation Failures](./003_root_cause_of_subagent_delegation_failures.md)** - Investigation of historical delegation failures showing resolution in spec 469 (October 2024) and perception issues from verbose bash scaffolding

## Cross-Report Findings

### Theme 1: Wave-Based Implementation is the Critical Gap

All four reports converge on the finding that **Phase 3 implementation lacks wave-based parallel execution**, which is the defining feature of /orchestrate. Report 001 identifies the specific missing components (dependency analysis, wave calculation, parallel invocation), Report 002 confirms compliance with architectural patterns otherwise, Report 003 rules out delegation failures as the root cause, and Report 004 provides concrete implementation guidance. The absence of this feature creates a **40-60% performance gap** compared to /orchestrate.

**Key Evidence**:
- Report 001 (Lines 51-76): Phase 3 uses single code-writer agent processing phases sequentially, no dependency graphs or wave execution
- Report 001 (Lines 113-118): Performance metrics show 40-60% time savings achievable with wave-based pattern
- Report 004 (Lines 148-149): /orchestrate has wave-based execution, /supervise does not (0% overlap on this feature)

### Theme 2: Standards Compliance is High (95%) with Targeted Violations

Reports 002 and 003 establish that /supervise demonstrates **excellent architectural compliance** at 95%, with only three specific, fixable violations. The command correctly uses Task tool invocation, implements orchestrator/executor role separation, and follows path pre-calculation patterns. This contradicts any perception of systemic architectural problems.

**Key Evidence**:
- Report 002 (Line 15): "95% adherence to Command Architecture Standards"
- Report 002 (Lines 235-279): 100% compliance on Task tool usage (no SlashCommand violations)
- Report 003 (Lines 55-67): All current Task invocations follow correct imperative patterns

**Identified Violations**:
1. **Behavioral content duplication** (Report 002, Lines 19-114): ~250 lines of STEP sequences inline in debug-analyst and code-writer prompts should be extracted to agent behavioral files
2. **Missing imperative markers** (Report 002, Lines 116-183): Two Task invocations lack "EXECUTE NOW" markers, creating 0% delegation risk
3. **Code-fenced anti-pattern example** (Report 002, Lines 185-229): YAML code block at lines 49-54 establishes priming risk despite anti-pattern labeling

**Resolution Impact**: All three violations are medium-severity and solvable in 3-4 hours total (Report 002, Line 408).

### Theme 3: Delegation Failures are Historical, Not Current

Report 003 conclusively demonstrates that **delegation failures were resolved in spec 469 (October 2024)**. The historical anti-pattern of code-fenced Task invocations causing "priming effect" (0% delegation rate) no longer exists in the current command. Any perception of delegation failure likely stems from verbose bash scaffolding (400+ lines) masking actual agent work, not from architectural problems.

**Key Evidence**:
- Report 003 (Lines 15-33): Timeline shows fix implemented on 2025-10-24, current /supervise uses correct unwrapped Task invocations
- Report 003 (Lines 71-80): Hypothesis that "67% scaffolding ratio" creates impression of low delegation despite correct architecture
- Report 003 (Lines 149-165): Recommendation to verify delegation actually works before making changes

**Perception vs Reality**: Report 003 (Lines 99-104) shows /supervise has 67% scaffolding-to-agent ratio, identical to /orchestrate, but feels more verbose due to inline bash rather than library references.

### Theme 4: Strategic Deprecation Recommended Over Enhancement

Reports 001 and 004 converge on the finding that /supervise has **90-95% functional overlap** with /orchestrate, with /orchestrate providing superior performance (wave-based execution) and additional features (PR creation, dry-run, dashboard). Report 004 provides comprehensive deprecation vs enhancement analysis with decision framework.

**Functional Overlap Analysis** (Report 004, Lines 137-150):
- Research Phase: 100% overlap
- Planning Phase: 100% overlap
- Implementation: 100% overlap
- Testing Phase: 100% overlap
- Debug Loop: 100% overlap
- Documentation: 100% overlap
- Workflow Scope Detection: 90% overlap
- Checkpoint Recovery: 100% overlap

**Unique to /orchestrate** (Report 004, Lines 149-154):
- Wave-based parallel implementation (40-60% time savings)
- PR creation automation
- Dry-run mode
- Dashboard progress tracking

**Usage Evidence** (Report 004, Lines 156-162):
- /orchestrate: 1 reference in CLAUDE.md
- /supervise: 0 references in CLAUDE.md
- /orchestrate prominently documented as "Multi-agent workflow coordination"
- /supervise not featured in README.md

**Recommendation**: Report 004 (Lines 171-175, 711-717) recommends **Option A: Deprecate /supervise** with gradual migration plan to minimize user disruption.

## Detailed Findings by Topic

### 1. Implementation Analysis

[Full Report](./001_supervise_command_implementation_analysis.md)

The command implements a 7-phase workflow orchestration system (Phase 0-6) that coordinates research, planning, implementation, testing, debugging, and documentation. Current implementation is architecturally sound with correct behavioral injection patterns, but **Phase 3 uses sequential implementation** where /orchestrate achieves 40-60% time savings through parallel wave-based execution. Five components are missing: dependency analysis, wave calculation, parallel phase invocation, wave-level checkpointing, and implementer-coordinator agent delegation. The gap analysis identifies low complexity changes (reuse existing libraries), medium complexity changes (modify Phase 3 invocation pattern), and high complexity changes (checkpoint schema modification and error handling).

**Key Recommendations**:
- Integrate dependency-analyzer.sh library for wave calculation
- Replace code-writer invocation with wave-based loop invoking implementer-coordinator
- Update checkpoint schema to track wave boundaries
- Add wave-level progress markers for visibility

### 2. Standards Violations

[Full Report](./002_standards_violations_and_pattern_deviations.md)

Three specific violations identified with 95% overall compliance: (1) Behavioral content duplication of ~250 lines across debug-analyst and code-writer Phase 5 prompts containing inline STEP sequences, PRIMARY OBLIGATION blocks, and verification steps that should be extracted to agent behavioral files (violates Standard 12), (2) Missing imperative instruction markers on two Task invocations at lines 1135-1155 and 1667-1677, lacking required "EXECUTE NOW" markers within 5 lines preceding Task blocks (violates Standard 11), and (3) Code-fenced YAML anti-pattern example at lines 49-54 that establishes priming risk despite clear anti-pattern labeling. The command demonstrates 100% compliance on orchestrator role separation, path pre-calculation pattern, and Task tool usage (no SlashCommand violations).

**Key Recommendations** (Priority Ordering):
1. **High Priority**: Add imperative instruction markers to prevent 0% delegation risk (30 minutes)
2. **High Priority**: Remove code fence from anti-pattern example to eliminate priming effect (15 minutes)
3. **Medium Priority**: Extract behavioral content to agent files for 90% reduction per invocation (2-3 hours)

### 3. Delegation Failure Root Cause

[Full Report](./003_root_cause_of_subagent_delegation_failures.md)

Historical delegation failures were caused by code-fenced Task invocation examples creating a "priming effect" where Claude interpreted all Task blocks as documentation rather than executable commands. This anti-pattern was documented and fixed in spec 469 on October 2024. **Current /supervise command does not suffer from delegation failures** - it follows correct imperative patterns with unwrapped Task invocations, imperative instructions present, direct behavioral file references, and explicit completion signals. Any perception of delegation failure likely stems from verbose inline bash scaffolding (400+ lines of setup code before first agent invocation) masking actual agent work, creating an impression that the command does work itself despite 67% scaffolding ratio being identical to /orchestrate.

**Key Recommendations**:
1. **Critical Priority**: Verify delegation actually works before making changes (test with sample workflows)
2. **High Priority**: If delegation works, reduce verbose inline bash by extracting to libraries (70% reduction potential)
3. **Medium Priority**: Align template presentation with /research command for clearer execution markers

### 4. Corrective Actions

[Full Report](./004_corrective_actions_and_improvement_recommendations.md)

Four comprehensive recommendations provided: (1) **Convert /plan invocation to enhanced Task-based pattern** - Update Phase 2 (lines 1225-1250) to match /orchestrate's comprehensive context injection including THINKING_MODE, formatted research reports list, explicit STEP 1-6 instructions, and research report count (2-3 hours, low risk), (2) **Add research subagent delegation following /research pattern** - Replace keyword-based complexity with structured scoring, enhance agent invocation template with topic focus, add topic decomposition logic (1-4 research topics), and add research overview synthesis for multiple reports (4-6 hours, medium risk), (3) **Implement context pruning utilities integration** - Add pruning after each phase completion using already-sourced context-pruning.sh utilities to achieve 80-90% context reduction for completed phases (1-2 hours, low risk), and (4) **Evaluate deprecation and create migration plan** - Choose between Option A (deprecate /supervise in favor of /orchestrate due to 90-95% functional overlap, superior performance, no unique features) or Option B (enhance /supervise and maintain both commands).

**Strategic Recommendation**: **Option A - Gradual Deprecation** with 4-phase migration plan:
- Phase 1: Deprecation warning (2-4 weeks)
- Phase 2: Migration guide creation (supervise-to-orchestrate.md)
- Phase 3: Deprecation enforcement, move to deprecated/ directory (4-8 weeks after warning)
- Phase 4: Final removal (12-16 weeks after warning)

## Recommended Approach

### Overall Strategy (Synthesized from All Reports)

**Primary Recommendation**: **Deprecate /supervise in favor of /orchestrate** based on:
1. **High functional overlap** (90-95% across all workflow phases)
2. **Performance gap** (40-60% time savings with wave-based execution)
3. **Feature superiority** (/orchestrate has PR creation, dry-run, dashboard)
4. **Usage evidence** (0 CLAUDE.md references vs 1 for /orchestrate)
5. **Maintenance efficiency** (single command to maintain vs dual maintenance)

**If enhancement is chosen instead**, implement in priority order:
1. Fix standards violations (3-4 hours total, prevents 0% delegation risk)
2. Enhance /plan invocation with comprehensive context (2-3 hours, improves plan quality)
3. Add research subagent delegation with complexity scoring (4-6 hours, improves research quality)
4. Integrate context pruning utilities (1-2 hours, reduces context bloat)
5. Add wave-based implementation to Phase 3 (NOT COVERED - requires separate analysis)

### Implementation Sequence (if deprecation chosen)

**Phase 1: Pre-Deprecation Cleanup (Week 1-2)**
1. Fix three standards violations in /supervise to ensure clean deprecated state
2. Document all /supervise functionality for migration guide
3. Create comprehensive /orchestrate feature parity documentation

**Phase 2: Deprecation Warning (Week 3-6)**
1. Add console warning to /supervise command
2. Create migration guide: `.claude/docs/migrations/supervise-to-orchestrate.md`
3. Update CLAUDE.md to recommend /orchestrate for workflow orchestration
4. Communicate deprecation timeline to users

**Phase 3: Migration Support (Week 7-14)**
1. Monitor migration progress and address user concerns
2. Update all internal examples to use /orchestrate
3. Move /supervise.md to `.claude/commands/deprecated/supervise.md`
4. Keep deprecated command functional but emit strong warning

**Phase 4: Final Removal (Week 15+)**
1. Remove /supervise.md entirely after 12-16 weeks
2. Update all references and tests
3. Archive migration guide
4. Evaluate migration success and lessons learned

### Integration Points Between Topics

**Connection 1: Standards Violations Block Deprecation**

Report 002's three violations must be fixed before deprecation to ensure clean deprecated state. Even though command will be deprecated, fixing violations takes only 3-4 hours and ensures documented anti-patterns don't propagate.

**Connection 2: Delegation Verification Before Enhancement**

Report 003's finding that delegation may already work correctly means Report 004's enhancement recommendations should only proceed AFTER verification testing. If delegation works, focus on perception improvements (library extraction) rather than architectural changes.

**Connection 3: Wave-Based Gap Drives Deprecation Decision**

Report 001's identification of the Phase 3 sequential implementation gap combined with Report 004's 90-95% functional overlap analysis strongly supports deprecation. Adding wave-based implementation to /supervise would effectively duplicate /orchestrate's most complex feature, doubling maintenance burden.

**Connection 4: Historical Context Informs Migration Strategy**

Report 003's timeline showing recent fixes (October 2024) suggests /supervise is actively maintained, which means deprecation must be gradual and well-communicated to avoid disrupting recent users who adopted the command post-fixes.

## Constraints and Trade-offs

### Constraint 1: User Disruption from Deprecation

**Limitation**: Deprecating /supervise impacts existing workflows and users who have learned the command syntax.

**Mitigation Strategies**:
- Gradual deprecation timeline (12-16 weeks minimum)
- Comprehensive migration guide with syntax mappings
- Keep deprecated command functional during transition
- Clear console warnings with migration resources
- Monitor usage patterns to identify high-impact users

**Trade-off**: Balancing technical debt reduction against user experience disruption. Reports recommend 3-4 month timeline to minimize impact.

### Constraint 2: Wave-Based Implementation Complexity

**Limitation**: Adding wave-based execution to /supervise (if enhancement chosen) requires significant engineering effort identified in Report 001 as "medium to high complexity changes."

**Design Trade-offs**:
- **Option A (Deprecation)**: Avoid engineering cost but require user migration
- **Option B (Enhancement)**: Maintain user continuity but double maintenance burden and engineering investment

**Risk Factors**: Report 001 (Lines 236-246) identifies checkpoint schema modification and error handling as high complexity changes, suggesting 20-40 hours of implementation effort plus testing.

### Constraint 3: Perception vs Reality in Delegation

**Limitation**: Report 003 identifies that verbose bash scaffolding (400+ lines) creates perception of low delegation despite correct architecture.

**Trade-off Options**:
1. **Extract to libraries** (Report 003, Lines 169-176): Reduces file from 2,177 lines to ~1,400 lines (35% reduction), improves perception, but requires library maintenance
2. **Leave inline** (status quo): Maintains self-contained command structure, no new dependencies, but perpetuates perception issues
3. **Deprecate** (recommended): Avoids investment in perception improvements, redirects users to cleaner /orchestrate architecture

**Mitigation if enhancement chosen**: Extract scaffolding to libraries following /orchestrate pattern, reducing Phase 1 from 500 lines to ~150 lines (70% reduction per Report 003).

### Constraint 4: Behavioral Content Extraction Impact

**Limitation**: Report 002's recommendation to extract 250 lines of behavioral content creates dependency on agent behavioral files being comprehensive and current.

**Risk Factors**:
- If agent behavioral files incomplete, extraction breaks command functionality
- Synchronization burden shifts from command file to agent file maintenance
- Multiple commands using same agents creates coupling risk

**Mitigation Strategy**: Before extraction, audit agent behavioral files for completeness:
- `.claude/agents/debug-analyst.md` must contain STEP 1-4 for debug analysis
- `.claude/agents/code-writer.md` must contain STEP 1-4 for fix application
- If gaps found, enhance agent files first, then extract from command

**Trade-off**: Single source of truth (agent files) vs command self-containment. Report 002 recommends single source of truth for 90% maintenance reduction.

### Constraint 5: Context Pruning Adoption Risk

**Limitation**: Report 004's context pruning integration assumes `.claude/lib/context-pruning.sh` utilities are stable and well-tested.

**Risk Factors**:
- Aggressive pruning may remove needed context for subsequent phases
- Utilities sourced but not currently used by /supervise (Report 004, Line 530)
- Integration testing required to ensure no functionality degradation

**Mitigation Strategy**:
1. Test pruning utilities in isolation before integration
2. Monitor context window usage across phases with instrumentation
3. Implement gradual pruning (50% threshold) before aggressive pruning (90% threshold)
4. Add verification checkpoints to detect missing pruned content

**Expected Impact**: 80-90% context reduction for completed phases with <5% risk of functionality degradation if proper verification implemented.
