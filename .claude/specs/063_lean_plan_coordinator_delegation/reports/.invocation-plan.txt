# Research Coordinator Invocation Plan
# Generated: $(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)

Expected Invocations: 3

Topics:
[0] Primary Agent Usage Analysis: Investigate why lean-plan-output.md shows excessive primary agent invocations instead of delegating research tasks to specialized agents -> /home/benjamin/.config/.claude/specs/063_lean_plan_coordinator_delegation/reports/001-primary-agent-usage-analysis.md
[1] Coordinator Research Delegation: Research how coordinator agents should be invoked for multi-topic research and why current implementation may be skipping this delegation step -> /home/benjamin/.config/.claude/specs/063_lean_plan_coordinator_delegation/reports/002-coordinator-delegation-patterns.md
[2] Planning Subagent Architecture: Analyze planning subagent architecture and determine why plan-generating commands are not delegating to these subagents -> /home/benjamin/.config/.claude/specs/063_lean_plan_coordinator_delegation/reports/003-planning-subagent-architecture.md

Status: PLAN_CREATED (invocations pending)
