## Revision History

### 2025-10-20 - Revision 1
**Changes**: Added enforcement of topic-based artifact organization from `.claude/docs/README.md` for all commands
**Reason**: User identified that artifacts created by subagents must follow the standardized topic-based directory structure (`specs/{NNN_topic}/reports/`, `specs/{NNN_topic}/plans/`, etc.) as documented in `.claude/docs/README.md` lines 114-138
**Modified Sections**: Problem Statement, Technical Design, All phases (artifact path calculations)
**Additional Requirements**:
- All subagents must create artifacts in topic-based structure
- Paths must use `create_topic_artifact()` utility for proper numbering
- Artifacts organized by type (reports/, plans/, summaries/, debug/)
- Complex artifacts use subdirectories (e.g., `027_research/027_topic.md`)

### 2025-10-20 - Revision 2
**Changes**: Removed all /setup command considerations from plan
**Reason**: User confirmed /setup invoking /orchestrate with explicit instructions is acceptable (not an anti-pattern)
**Modified Sections**: Problem Statement, Goals, Success Criteria, Technical Design (Fix 3 removed), Phase 4 removed, all testing/documentation references to /setup
**Scope Reduction**: Plan now addresses 2 commands (/orchestrate, /implement) instead of 3

### 2025-10-20 - Revision 3
**Changes**: Added requirement that plans reference all research reports, and summaries reference both plans and reports
**Reason**: User identified that artifacts created during /orchestrate workflow must maintain proper cross-references:
  - Plans created by plan-architect must list all research reports from research phase
  - Summaries created by summarizer must reference the plan and all research reports
**Modified Sections**: Success Criteria, Phase 3 (plan-architect behavioral injection), Phase 5 (documentation)
**Cross-Reference Requirements**:
  - plan-architect agent: Include "Research Reports" metadata section with paths to all reports
  - summarizer agent: Include "Artifacts Generated" section with plan path + report paths
  - Enables traceability and audit trail for complete workflow

### 2025-10-20 - Revision 4
**Changes**: Expanded scope to include multi-agent research pattern for /report and /orchestrate research phases
**Reason**: User identified systematic issue where commands should use hierarchical research pattern:
  - /orchestrate research phase: Currently correct (uses research-specialist subagents directly)
  - /report command: Should invoke multiple research-specialist subagents (one per topic), each creating individual reports, then invoke overview-agent to synthesize findings with links to individual reports
**Modified Sections**: Problem Statement, Goals, Success Criteria, Phase 3 (add /report multi-agent pattern), Technical Design
**New Pattern Requirements**:
  - Research commands invoke parallel research-specialist agents (one per topic)
  - Each agent creates topic-specific report in topic-based structure
  - Overview agent synthesizes findings with references to individual reports
  - Enables parallel research execution and granular topic coverage
**Scope Impact**: Adds /report command refactoring to existing /orchestrate and /implement fixes

## Overview

**Problem Statement:**

Three .claude/ commands suffer from fundamental anti-patterns in subagent delegation:

**Delegation Anti-Patterns** (agents invoking slash commands):
1. **`/orchestrate`** (HIGH severity):
   - plan-architect agent invokes `/plan` command instead of creating plans directly
   - Research phase: CORRECT pattern (uses parallel research-specialist agents) **[Revision 4]**
2. **`/implement`** (HIGH severity): code-writer agent invokes `/implement` command (recursion risk)
3. **`/report`** (HIGH severity): Should use hierarchical multi-agent research pattern **[NEW - Revision 4]**
   - Current: Single report created directly by command
   - Correct: Invoke parallel research-specialist agents (one per topic) → Each creates individual report → Overview agent synthesizes with links

**Artifact Organization Non-Compliance** (identified in Revision 1):
4. **All commands** (MEDIUM severity): Subagents may not consistently follow topic-based artifact organization standard documented in `.claude/docs/README.md` (lines 114-138)

**Standardized Artifact Structure** (from `.claude/docs/README.md`):
```
specs/{NNN_topic}/
├── reports/          Research reports (gitignored)
│   ├── {NNN}_research/       # Multiple reports from one task
│   │   ├── {NNN}_OVERVIEW.md
│   │   ├── {NNN}_topic_1.md
│   │   ├── {NNN}_topic_2.md
│   │   └── {NNN}_topic_3.md
│   └── {NNN}_single.md       # Single report (no subdirectory)
├── plans/            Implementation plans (gitignored)

│   │   ├── {NNN}_PLAN.md     # Level 0 (main plan)

│   │   └── phase_N/          # Level 2 (stages)

├── summaries/        Workflow summaries (gitignored)
├── debug/            Debug reports (COMMITTED for history!)
├── scripts/          Investigation scripts (temp, gitignored)
└── outputs/          Test outputs (temp, gitignored)
```

This violates the **behavioral injection pattern** and **artifact organization standards** resulting in:
- Recursive delegation chains (command → agent → command → ...)
- Loss of context control and metadata extraction
- Violation of hierarchical agent architecture principles
- Inconsistency with correct implementations (/plan, /report, /debug)
- **Non-standard artifact locations** (reports/plans not in topic directories)
- **Inconsistent numbering** across artifacts
- **Poor artifact discoverability** (scattered locations instead of centralized topic dirs)

**Solution Approach:**

Implement the behavioral injection pattern system-wide AND enforce topic-based artifact organization:
- Remove slash command invocations from agent behavioral files
- Update commands to inject behavioral prompts with pre-calculated paths
- **Enforce topic-based artifact organization** (`specs/{NNN_topic}/`) for all artifacts
- **Use `create_topic_artifact()` utility** for consistent path calculation and numbering
- Establish consistent agent delegation standards across all commands
- Document the correct pattern for future command development

### Goals

1. **Fix /orchestrate planning phase**: Remove plan-architect → /plan delegation, ensure topic-based plan paths
2. **Verify /orchestrate research phase**: Confirm correct multi-agent pattern (already implemented) **[Revision 4]**
3. **Fix /implement**: Remove code-writer → /implement recursion risk
4. **Fix /report**: Implement hierarchical multi-agent research pattern (parallel research-specialists → overview agent) **[NEW - Revision 4]**
5. **Enforce artifact organization**: All subagents create artifacts in topic-based structure
6. **Establish standards**: Document correct behavioral injection pattern AND multi-agent research pattern
7. **Prevent regression**: Add validation tests for all commands AND artifact path compliance
8. **Reference implementations**: Update documentation to reflect multi-agent research pattern

## Success Criteria

**Code Changes:**
- [ ] `/orchestrate` plan-architect agent creates plans directly (no /plan invocation)
- [ ] `/orchestrate` research phase verified using correct multi-agent pattern **[Revision 4]**

- [ ] All agent behavioral files follow consistent pattern (no SlashCommand for artifacts)
- [ ] **All commands use `create_topic_artifact()` for path calculation** (enforces topic-based organization)

**Artifact Organization:**

- [ ] **All plans** created in `specs/{NNN_topic}/plans/` (never flat in `specs/plans/`)
- [ ] **All summaries** created in `specs/{NNN_topic}/summaries/`
- [ ] **Debug reports** created in `specs/{NNN_topic}/debug/` (and committed to git)
- [ ] **Consistent numbering** using `get_next_artifact_number()` utility
- [ ] **Complex artifacts** use subdirectories (e.g., `027_research/027_topic_1.md`)
- [ ] **Plans reference all research reports** in metadata section **[Revision 3]**
- [ ] **Summaries reference plan + all reports** in artifacts section **[Revision 3]**

**Testing:**
- [ ] All existing tests passing (regression prevention)
- [ ] New tests validate no slash command invocations from agents
- [ ] Integration tests confirm artifacts created at correct topic-based paths
- [ ] Code-writer agent test confirms no /implement recursion
- [ ] **Artifact path validation tests** (verify topic-based structure compliance)

**Documentation:**
- [x] Behavioral injection pattern documented in hierarchical_agents.md ✅ Phase 1
- [ ] Agent authoring guidelines updated in agents/README.md
- [x] Command authoring guidelines created ✅ Phase 1 (command-authoring-guide.md)
- [x] Anti-patterns documented with examples ✅ Phase 1 (agent-authoring-guide.md)
- [x] **Artifact organization standards** referenced from docs/README.md ✅ Phase 1 (both guides reference README.md)

**Metrics:**
- [ ] Zero SlashCommand invocations from subagents for artifact creation
- [ ] 100% of artifact-creating agents use direct file operations
- [ ] /orchestrate context reduction ≥95% (as per original plan)
- [ ] **100% of artifacts in topic-based directories** (none in flat structures)

## Technical Design

### Core Anti-Pattern Identified

**WRONG Pattern** (found in /orchestrate, /implement, /setup):
```
Primary Command
  ↓
Invokes Task tool → Agent
  ↓
Agent uses SlashCommand tool → Secondary Command
  ↓
Secondary Command creates artifact
```

**Problems:**
- Loss of control over artifact paths
- Cannot extract metadata before context bloat
- Recursive delegation risk
- Violates hierarchical agent architecture

**CORRECT Pattern** (from /plan, /report, /debug):
```
Primary Command
  ↓
1. Calculate topic-based absolute artifact path using create_topic_artifact()
   Format: specs/{NNN_topic}/reports/{NNN}_artifact.md
           specs/{NNN_topic}/plans/{NNN}_artifact.md
           specs/{NNN_topic}/summaries/{NNN}_artifact.md
  ↓
2. Load agent behavioral prompt (if needed)
3. Inject complete context:
   - Agent behavioral guidelines
   - Task-specific requirements
   - ARTIFACT_PATH="..." (pre-calculated, topic-based)
   - Success criteria
  ↓
Invokes Task tool → Agent (with complete context)
  ↓
Agent creates artifact directly using Read/Write/Edit tools
AT THE EXACT TOPIC-BASED PATH PROVIDED
  ↓
Primary Command verifies artifact exists at topic-based path
  ↓
Primary Command extracts metadata (path + summary only)
```

**Benefits:**
- Full control over artifact paths and naming
- **Topic-based organization** (centralized artifacts per feature/workflow)
- **Consistent numbering** across all artifact types
- **Easy artifact discovery** (all workflow artifacts in one topic directory)
- Metadata extraction before context bloat
- No recursion risk
- Consistent with hierarchical architecture

### Two Distinct Fixes Required

#### Fix 1: /orchestrate Planning Phase AND Research Phase Artifact Organization

**Current Problems**:

**Problem 1A** (orchestrate.md:1107 - Planning Phase):
```markdown
Invoke Task tool with plan-architect agent:
- Agent instructed to use SlashCommand(/plan)
- Plan path not pre-calculated
- No verification or metadata extraction
```

**Problem 1B** (orchestrate.md:417-617 - Research Phase):
```markdown
Research agents may create reports:
- Research phase DOES use research-specialist agents (correct!)
- Research phase DOES pre-calculate paths (correct!)
- VERIFY: Paths use topic-based structure specs/{NNN_topic}/reports/
- VERIFY: Uses create_topic_artifact() utility for consistent numbering
```

**Fix Approach:**

**Planning Phase Fix:**
```markdown
1. Calculate topic-based plan path BEFORE agent invocation using create_topic_artifact():
   source "${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}/.claude/lib/artifact-creation.sh"
   TOPIC_DIR=$(get_or_create_topic_dir "$WORKFLOW_DESCRIPTION" "specs")
   PLAN_PATH=$(create_topic_artifact "$TOPIC_DIR" "plans" "implementation" "")
   # Result: specs/{NNN_workflow}/plans/{NNN}_implementation.md

2. Load plan-architect behavioral prompt (NO slash command instructions):
   - Agent creates plan file directly at topic-based PLAN_PATH
   - Agent uses Write tool, not SlashCommand
   - Agent returns metadata (path + phase count + complexity)

3. Verify plan created at topic-based path and extract metadata
```

**Research Phase Verification:**
```markdown
1. Verify orchestrate.md lines 518-544 use create_topic_artifact():
   REPORT_PATH=$(create_topic_artifact "$WORKFLOW_TOPIC_DIR" "reports" "${topic}" "")
   # Result: specs/{NNN_workflow}/reports/{NNN}_topic.md

2. Ensure all research reports created in topic-based structure
3. Confirm get_or_create_topic_dir() used for topic directory creation
```

**Files to Modify:**
- `.claude/commands/orchestrate.md` (lines 1086-1150 - planning phase path calculation)
- `.claude/commands/orchestrate.md` (lines 518-544 - verify research uses topic-based paths)
- `.claude/agents/plan-architect.md` (remove lines 64-88 - SlashCommand instructions)
- `.claude/shared/workflow-phases.md` (update planning phase template with topic-based paths)

#### Fix 2: /implement Code-Writer Agent

**Current Problem** (code-writer.md:11, 29, 53):
```markdown
Agent behavioral file contains instructions:
- "USE /implement command for plan-based implementation"
- "YOU MUST use /implement command with this path"
- "USE SlashCommand tool to invoke /implement"

Creates recursion risk:
  /implement → code-writer agent → /implement → ...
```

**Fix Approach:**
```markdown
1. Remove all /implement invocation instructions from code-writer.md
2. Remove "Type A: Plan-Based Implementation" section entirely
3. Clarify: code-writer receives TASKS, not plan paths
4. code-writer uses Read/Write/Edit tools only (never SlashCommand)
```

**Key Insight:**
The code-writer agent should NEVER invoke /implement. The /implement command itself delegates to code-writer for EXECUTION of tasks within a plan, not for parsing plans.

**Correct Flow:**
```
/implement command (parses plan)
  ↓
For each phase:
  ↓
Invokes code-writer agent with TASKS from that phase
  ↓
code-writer executes tasks directly (Read/Write/Edit tools)
```

**Files to Modify:**
- `.claude/agents/code-writer.md` (remove lines 11, 29, 53, entire Type A section)
- Update examples (lines 329-394) to remove /implement references
- Clarify STEP 1: "You receive specific TASKS, not plan file paths"

### Shared Utilities (from original plan)

**Already Planned**: `.claude/lib/agent-loading-utils.sh`
```bash
# Load agent behavioral prompt (strip frontmatter)
load_agent_behavioral_prompt() {
  local agent_name="$1"
  local agent_file="${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}/.claude/agents/${agent_name}.md"

  if [[ ! -f "$agent_file" ]]; then
    echo "ERROR: Agent file not found: $agent_file" >&2
    return 1
  fi

  # Strip YAML frontmatter (between --- markers)
  sed -n '/^---$/,/^---$/!p' "$agent_file" | sed '1,/^---$/d'
}

# Calculate next artifact number in directory
get_next_artifact_number() {
  local artifact_dir="$1"
  local next_num=$(find "$artifact_dir" -name "[0-9][0-9][0-9]_*.md" 2>/dev/null | wc -l)
  printf "%03d" $((next_num + 1))
}

# Verify artifact exists with fallback recovery
verify_artifact_or_recover() {
  local expected_path="$1"
  local topic_slug="$2"
  local artifact_dir=$(dirname "$expected_path")

  if [[ -f "$expected_path" ]]; then
    echo "$expected_path"
    return 0
  fi

  # Attempt recovery: find artifact with matching topic slug
  local actual_path=$(find "$artifact_dir" -name "*${topic_slug}*" 2>/dev/null | head -1)

  if [[ -n "$actual_path" ]]; then
    echo "RECOVERED: Found artifact at: $actual_path" >&2
    echo "$actual_path"
    return 0
  fi

  echo "ERROR: Artifact not found: $expected_path" >&2
  return 1
}
```

**Usage in Commands:**
```bash
# In /orchestrate planning phase:
source "${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}/.claude/lib/agent-loading-utils.sh"

# Option 1: Use behavioral injection (if agent needs custom behavior)
AGENT_PROMPT=$(load_agent_behavioral_prompt "plan-architect")
PLAN_PATH="${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}/specs/${TOPIC}/plans/001_implementation.md"

COMPLETE_PROMPT="$AGENT_PROMPT

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Shared Utilities and Standards Documentation (EXPANDED) [COMPLETED]

**Objective**: Create shared utilities and document the correct behavioral injection pattern

**Complexity**: Medium (Analysis: 7/10 - High architectural significance)

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED (2025-10-20)

**Summary**: Establishes foundational utilities (`load_agent_behavioral_prompt`, `get_next_artifact_number`, `verify_artifact_or_recover`) and comprehensive documentation (2 guides + architecture updates) that define behavioral injection pattern standards for all subsequent phases.

For detailed tasks and implementation, see **[Phase 1 Details](phase_1_shared_utilities.md)** (2,701 lines)

**Key Deliverables**:
- ✅ 1 utility library with 3 core functions (agent-loading-utils.sh)
- ✅ 2 comprehensive guides (agent-authoring-guide.md, command-authoring-guide.md)
- ✅ Architecture documentation updates (hierarchical_agents.md)
- ✅ 11 unit tests (100% passing, fixed octal bug)

**Actual Time**: 4 hours

**Git Commit**: 7eb24f7e - "feat: add shared utilities for behavioral injection pattern (Phase 1)"

---

### Phase 2: Fix /implement Code-Writer Agent [COMPLETED]

**Objective**: Remove recursive /implement invocation risk from code-writer agent

**Complexity**: Low (pure deletion, no complex refactoring)

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED (2025-10-20)

**Tasks**:

- [x] Read `.claude/agents/code-writer.md` to identify all /implement references
  - Line 11: "USE /implement command for plan-based implementation"
  - Line 29: "YOU MUST use /implement command with this path"
  - Line 53: "USE SlashCommand tool to invoke /implement"

- [x] Remove "Type A: Plan-Based Implementation" section entirely
  - This section instructs agent to invoke /implement (wrong)
  - code-writer should only handle direct task execution

- [x] Update STEP 1 to clarify agent receives TASKS
  - Old: "You may receive a plan file path OR specific code change tasks"
  - New: "You receive specific code change TASKS from the calling command"

- [x] Remove /implement examples from lines 329-394
  - Replace with direct task execution examples
  - Emphasize: agent uses Read/Write/Edit tools only

- [x] Add explicit anti-pattern warning
  ```markdown
  ## CRITICAL: Do NOT Invoke Slash Commands

  **NEVER** use the SlashCommand tool to invoke:
  - /implement (recursion risk - YOU are invoked BY /implement)
  - /plan (plan creation is /plan command's responsibility)
  - /report (research is research-specialist's responsibility)

  **ALWAYS** use Read/Write/Edit tools to modify code directly.
  ```

**Testing**:
```bash
# Created test to verify code-writer doesn't invoke slash commands
.claude/tests/test_code_writer_no_recursion.sh

# Test results: ✅ 10/10 tests passed
# - No /implement invocation instructions
# - No SlashCommand(/implement) pattern
# - Type A section removed
# - Anti-pattern warning exists
# - Explicit recursion warning documented
# - STEP 1 clarifies receiving TASKS
# - No plan file path instructions
# - Read/Write/Edit tools emphasized
# - No other slash command invocations
# - NEVER invoke slash commands in critical instructions
```

**Files Modified**:
- `.claude/agents/code-writer.md` (removed lines 11, 29, 53, Type A section, added anti-pattern warning)

**Files Created**:
- `.claude/tests/test_code_writer_no_recursion.sh` (10 tests, all passing)

**Actual Output**:
- ✅ code-writer agent no longer contains /implement invocation instructions
- ✅ Clear documentation that agent executes tasks, not plans
- ✅ Test confirms no SlashCommand usage for /implement (10/10 tests passing)
- ✅ Zero recursion risk

**Actual Time**: 30 minutes

### Phase 7: Implement Hierarchical Multi-Agent Research Pattern for /report (EXPANDED) **[NEW - Revision 4]**

**Objective**: Refactor /report command to use hierarchical multi-agent research pattern

**Complexity**: High (Analysis: 8/10 - Multi-agent coordination, overview synthesis)

**Status**: PENDING

**Summary**: Transforms /report from single-report creation to hierarchical pattern with 4 stages: (1) Topic decomposition utility creates 2-4 subtopics via LLM analysis, (2) Parallel research-specialist agents invoked in single message (one per subtopic) with pre-calculated paths, (3) Research-synthesizer agent creates overview report with cross-cutting themes and links to all individual reports, (4) Integration with spec-updater for complete cross-references. Achieves 40-60% time savings via parallelization and 95% context reduction per agent.

For detailed tasks and implementation, see **[Phase 7 Details](phase_7_report_multi_agent_pattern.md)** (2,314 lines)

**Key Deliverables**:
- topic-decomposition.sh utility (120+ lines)
- research-synthesizer agent behavioral file (420+ lines)
- /report command refactored (300+ lines modified)
- Integration tests for multi-agent pattern (150+ lines)
- Complete artifact templates and examples

**Artifact Structure** (example):
```
specs/042_authentication/reports/001_research/
├── OVERVIEW.md                      # Overview synthesis
├── 001_jwt_patterns.md              # Individual report 1
├── 002_oauth2_flows.md              # Individual report 2
├── 003_session_management.md        # Individual report 3
└── 004_security_best_practices.md   # Individual report 4
```

**Estimated Time**: 4-5 hours

**Dependencies**: Phase 1 (utilities), Phase 5 (documentation)

## Dependencies

### Internal Dependencies
- **CLAUDE.md**: Project standards (existing)
- **Hierarchical Agents Architecture**: Design patterns (existing)
- **Agent Behavioral Files**: Specifications (modified in Phases 2-4)
- **Command Files**: /orchestrate, /implement, /setup (modified in Phases 2-4)

### External Dependencies
- **Claude Code Task Tool**: Must support subagent_type parameter (confirmed working)
- **File System**: Standard file operations (Read/Write/Edit tools)
- **Bash Utilities**: sed, grep, find, jq (standard)

### Risk Mitigation

- **Validation**: Automated anti-pattern detection prevents future violations

## Notes

### Design Decisions

**Decision 1**: Fix all three commands in single plan
- **Rationale**: Same root cause, same solution pattern, coordinated fixes more efficient
- **Trade-off**: Larger plan, but eliminates duplicated effort and ensures consistency
- **Benefit**: System-wide standards established, not piecemeal fixes

**Decision 2**: Create shared utilities first (Phase 1)
- **Rationale**: All fixes depend on same utilities (path calculation, verification)
- **Trade-off**: Delays visible fixes, but enables cleaner implementations
- **Benefit**: Reusable across all commands, maintains DRY principle

**Decision 3**: Comprehensive documentation (Phase 6)
- **Rationale**: Prevent future violations, educate command/agent authors
- **Trade-off**: Significant documentation effort, but essential for long-term maintainability
- **Benefit**: Self-service resource for developers, reduces support burden

**Decision 4**: Extensive testing (Phases 5, 7)
- **Rationale**: High-risk changes (commands are core infrastructure)
- **Trade-off**: Test development time, but critical for confidence
- **Benefit**: Regression prevention, validation of all fixes, production readiness

### Complexity Analysis

**Overall Complexity: High (82/100)**

Breakdown:
- Phase 1 (Utilities & Docs): Medium (40/100) - New utilities, initial documentation
- Phase 2 (code-writer): Low (20/100) - Pure deletion, minimal refactoring
- Phase 3 (orchestrate): High (75/100) - Complex refactor, multi-file changes
- Phase 4 (setup): Medium (50/100) - Logic change, workflow adjustment
- Phase 5 (Validation): Medium (55/100) - System-wide scanning, new validators
- Phase 6 (Documentation): Medium (45/100) - Comprehensive docs, many examples
- Phase 7 (Integration): High (70/100) - E2E testing, workflow validation

**Risk Factors**:
- ⚠️ Multi-command coordination (higher integration risk)
- ⚠️ Core infrastructure changes (commands are heavily used)
- ✅ Clear anti-pattern definition (well-understood problem)
- ✅ Reference implementations exist (/plan, /report, /debug)
- ✅ Comprehensive testing strategy (mitigates risk)

### Performance Metrics

**Baseline (Before Fixes)**:
- /orchestrate research + planning: 168.9k tokens (per original analysis)
- code-writer recursion risk: Potential infinite loops
- /setup unnecessary delegation: 2-3x overhead

**Target (After Fixes)**:
- /orchestrate research + planning: <30k tokens (95% reduction)
- code-writer: Zero recursion risk
- /setup: Direct artifact creation (eliminate delegation overhead)
- All commands: Context reduction ≥90%

**Measured Results** (to be filled during Phase 7):
- /orchestrate token usage: ___ (target: <30k)
- Context reduction achieved: ___% (target: ≥95%)
- code-writer recursion tests: ___ (target: 0 violations)
- /setup delegation tests: ___ (target: 0 slash command invocations)

## Summary

This comprehensive plan fixes the fundamental anti-pattern across two .claude/ commands where agents were incorrectly instructed to invoke slash commands instead of creating artifacts directly, AND enforces topic-based artifact organization.

### Impact

**Before:**
- ❌ /orchestrate: plan-architect → SlashCommand(/plan)
- ❌ /implement: code-writer → SlashCommand(/implement) recursion risk
- ❌ Artifacts may not follow topic-based structure (`specs/{NNN_topic}/`)
- Context bloat: 168.9k tokens (no reduction)
- Inconsistency with /plan, /report, /debug reference implementations

**After:**
- ✅ All agents create artifacts directly using Read/Write/Edit tools
- ✅ Commands pre-calculate topic-based paths, inject behavioral prompts
- ✅ **All artifacts in topic-based structure** (`specs/{NNN_topic}/reports/`, etc.)
- ✅ Metadata-only context preservation (95% reduction)
- ✅ Zero recursion risk
- ✅ Consistent with hierarchical agent architecture
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation and testing
- ✅ Automated anti-pattern detection prevents regression

### Deliverables

**Code Changes:**
- 2 agent behavioral files fixed (code-writer, plan-architect)
- 2 command files refactored (orchestrate, implement)
- 1 shared utility library (agent-loading-utils.sh)
- Topic-based artifact paths enforced across all commands

**Documentation:**
- 2 comprehensive guides (agent-authoring, command-authoring with topic-based paths)
- 3 example documents (workflow, invocation, references)
- 1 troubleshooting guide (including artifact organization issues)
- Updated hierarchical agents architecture docs

**Testing:**
- 12 test files (unit, component, system validation, integration, E2E)
- 100% agent file coverage (anti-pattern detection)
- 100% command coverage (behavioral injection compliance)
- Topic-based artifact organization validation
- Regression test suite (all existing tests passing)

### Timeline

**Estimated Implementation Time**: 18-23 hours across 7 phases **[Updated in Revision 4]**

**Phase Breakdown**:
- Phase 1 (Utilities & Docs): 3-4 hours
- Phase 2 (code-writer fix): 2 hours
- Phase 3 (/orchestrate fix): 4-5 hours
- Phase 4 (System-wide validation): 2-3 hours
- Phase 5 (Documentation): 3-4 hours
- Phase 6 (Integration testing): 2-3 hours
- Phase 7 (/report multi-agent pattern): 4-5 hours **[NEW - Revision 4]**

**Risk Level**: Medium-High (core infrastructure changes + new multi-agent pattern, but well-understood problem and comprehensive testing) **[Updated in Revision 4]**

**Priority**: High (affects core workflow commands, performance impact, architectural inconsistency, enables parallel research execution)

### Success Metrics

Upon completion:
- ✅ Zero SlashCommand invocations from agents for artifact creation
- ✅ 95% context reduction in /orchestrate (168.9k → <30k tokens)
- ✅ Zero code-writer recursion risk
- ✅ Zero unnecessary delegation in /setup
- ✅ 100% anti-pattern detection coverage
- ✅ 100% behavioral injection compliance
- ✅ All tests passing (13/13 new tests + all existing tests)
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation for future development

**Next Steps**: Begin Phase 1 (Shared Utilities and Standards Documentation) and proceed sequentially through phases with testing at each step.
