updater agent from being called after the implementation of the phase was 
completed in order to design a plan to fix this issue. 
  ⎿  Allowed 7 tools for this command

● I'll investigate why the spec updater agent isn't being called after
  phase completion to update the plan files. Let me create a task list
  and begin the investigation.

● Let me start by examining the /implement command to understand how it
   should be calling the spec updater agent.

● Read(.claude/commands/implement.md)
  ⎿  Read 1796 lines

● Now let me search for the specific plan files mentioned to understand
   the structure:

● Read(.claude/specs/002_report_creation/plans/002_fix_all_command_subagent
      _delegation/002_fix_all_command_subagent_delegation.md)
  ⎿  Read 1045 lines

● Let me also check the phase 5 expanded file:

● Read(.claude/specs/002_report_creation/plans/002_fix_all_command_subagent
      _delegation/phase_5_documentation.md)
  ⎿  Error: File content (27950 tokens) exceeds maximum allowed tokens 
     (25000). Please use offset and limit parameters to read specific 
     portions of the file, or use the GrepTool to search for specific 
     content.

● Let me read a specific portion of the phase 5 file to understand its
  structure:

● Read(.claude/specs/002_report_creation/plans/002_fix_all_command_subagent
      _delegation/phase_5_documentation.md)
  ⎿  Read 100 lines

● Now let me update my task list and search for where the spec-updater
  invocation should be happening in the /implement command:

● Let me search for the spec-updater invocation section in the
  /implement command:

● Search(pattern: "spec-updater|spec updater|Spec-Updater|Spec Updater",
        path: ".claude/commands/implement.md", output_mode: "content")
  ⎿  Found 6 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

● Good! Now let me check if the spec-updater agent file exists:

● Bash(ls -la /home/benjamin/.config/.claude/agents/spec-updater.md)
  ⎿ -rw-r--r-- 1 benjamin users 30672 Oct 20 11:56 /home/benjamin/.con
    fig/.claude/agents/spec-updater.md


● The spec-updater agent file exists. Now let me examine the actual
  implementation logs or git history to see what happened during phase
  5:

● Bash(git log --oneline --all --grep="phase 5\|Phase 5"
      --since="2025-10-19" | head -20)
  ⎿ 70f6e533 docs: Phase 6 COMPLETE - Final achievement: 95/100 produc

    … +33 lines (ctrl+o to expand)


● Let me check the most recent commit that completed phase 5:

● Bash(git show --stat 463f94ec)
  ⎿  commit 463f94ecd60cca4ab58278b08eb32e5f3c3d269a

     … +45 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

● Let me check what phase was actually being worked on. Looking at the
  git status, I see this is the
  "002_fix_all_command_subagent_delegation" plan. Let me read the
  checkpoint data if it exists:

● Bash(find /home/benjamin/.config/.claude/data/checkpoints -name
      "*implement*" -type f 2>/dev/null | head -5)
  ⎿  (No content)

● Let me check if there's evidence of what actually happened during the
   implementation. Let me look at the main plan file to see when phase
  5 was marked complete:

● Bash(git log --all --oneline --since="2025-10-19" --
      ".claude/specs/002_report_creation/plans/002_fix_all_command_subagent

● I see! Phase 4 was completed but the plan wasn't updated. Let me
  check the /implement command section where the spec-updater should be
   invoked more carefully:

● Read(.claude/commands/implement.md)
  ⎿  Read 150 lines

● Now I understand the structure. The /implement command has detailed
  instructions to invoke the spec-updater agent after each phase
  completion (STEP A and STEP B), but this appears not to have
  happened. Let me investigate the root cause by examining the phase
  execution flow more carefully. Let me check where in the implement
  command this STEP A/B should be called:

● Search(pattern: "STEP 4|STEP 5|git commit|Phase Execution Protocol",
        path: ".claude/commands/implement.md", output_mode: "content")
  ⎿  Found 104 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

● Now let me update my understanding and search for where STEP A/B fits
   into the execution flow:

● Let me look at the structure more carefully. The "Plan Hierarchy
  Update After Phase Completion" section (lines 415-553) defines STEP A
   and STEP B, but I need to see where this fits into the overall phase
   execution protocol:

● Read(.claude/commands/implement.md)
  ⎿  Read 100 lines

● I see the issue now! The "Plan Hierarchy Update After Phase
  Completion" section (which includes STEP A and STEP B for
  spec-updater invocation) appears between step 6 of the "Wave
  Execution Flow" and the subsequent implementation steps. This
  placement is problematic because:

  1. It's not clearly integrated into the numbered step sequence
  2. It appears as a sub-heading under "Phase Execution Protocol" but
  after the "Wave Execution Flow" section
  3. The actual execution steps (STEP 2, STEP 3, STEP 4, STEP 5) come
  AFTER this section

  Let me confirm this by looking at where STEP 2, 3, 4, 5 are located:

● Search(pattern: "^\*\*STEP [0-9]", path: ".claude/commands/implement.md",
         output_mode: "content")
  ⎿  Found 4 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

● Now let me check where STEP A and STEP B are:

● Bash(grep -n "^\*\*STEP [AB]"
      /home/benjamin/.config/.claude/commands/implement.md)
  ⎿ 434:**STEP A (REQUIRED BEFORE STEP B) - Invoke Spec-Updater Agent*
    *
    487:**STEP B (REQUIRED AFTER STEP A) - Mandatory Verification with
     Fallback**



● Perfect! Now I've identified the root cause:

  ROOT CAUSE: STEP A and STEP B (spec-updater invocation) appear at
  lines 434-553, which is BEFORE STEP 2, 3, 4, 5 (lines 928-1300+).
  This creates a structural problem in the command documentation where:

  1. The execution flow says "5. Delegation" then "6. Testing and
  Commit" (line 411-412)
  2. But then immediately after, there's a new section "Plan Hierarchy
  Update After Phase Completion" with STEP A/B (lines 415-553)
  3. Then much later, the actual STEP 2 (Implementation), STEP 3
  (Testing), STEP 4 (Git Commit), STEP 5 (Plan Update) appear (lines
  928+)

  This means STEP A/B are orphaned from the main execution flow and
  likely not being executed because they're not properly integrated
  into the sequential step numbering.

  Let me update my tasks and begin investigating the solution:

● Now let me check what STEP 5 currently does to understand if there's
  duplication:

● Read(.claude/commands/implement.md)
  ⎿  Read 50 lines

● I see! STEP 5 is about manually updating plan files using Edit tool
  to mark checkboxes. But STEP A/B (which should come BEFORE STEP 5) is
   about invoking the spec-updater agent to do this automatically using
   the checkbox-utils.sh library.

  There's a conflict and redundancy here:
  - STEP A/B (lines 434-553): Invoke spec-updater agent to update
  checkboxes via mark_phase_complete utility
  - STEP 5 (line 1209+): Manually update checkboxes using Edit tool

  The proper flow should be:
  1. STEP 2: Implementation
  2. STEP 3: Testing
  3. STEP 4: Git Commit
  4. STEP 4.5 (A/B): Invoke spec-updater agent to update plan hierarchy
   (CURRENTLY ORPHANED)
  5. STEP 5: Update progress section (or this becomes redundant if
  spec-updater does it)

  Let me create a comprehensive investigation report and plan:

● Now let me create a comprehensive debug report documenting this
  issue:

● Excellent! Now let me complete the investigation by creating an
  implementation plan to fix this issue:

> /plan is running… Fix /implement command structure to integrate 
spec-updater invocation (STEP A/B) into main execution flow after STEP 4. 
Root cause: STEP A/B orphaned at lines 434-553, appearing ~500 lines before
 main execution steps (STEP 2-5 at lines 928+), causing spec-updater agent 
to never be called after phase completion. Solution: Restructure command to
 place STEP A/B as STEP 4.5 immediately after Git Commit, renumber 
subsequent steps, remove redundancy with STEP 5. See debug report: 
.claude/specs/002_report_creation/debug/001_spec_updater_not_called.md
