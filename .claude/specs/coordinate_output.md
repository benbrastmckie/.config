> /coordinate is running… research the 
/home/benjamin/.config/nvim/docs/ directory in order to plan
 and implement a refactor of this directory, keeping track 
of all references to these files from elsewhere in the 
repository and creating a README.md which documents the 
contents of this directory. The aim is to provide well 
organized documentation with good cross linking and minimal 
repetition. 
  ⎿  Allowed 4 tools for this command

● I'll orchestrate a comprehensive workflow to research,
   plan, and implement a refactor of the
  /home/benjamin/.config/nvim/docs/ directory. Let me
  begin by initializing the workflow.

● Bash(bash << 'EOF'
      # ════════════════════════════════════════════════════

  ⎿  Phase 0: Initialization started

    suming from Phase 0

● Good - Phase 0 completed successfully. The error about
   REPORT_PATH_4 is expected since we only have 3 report
   paths initialized. Let me now proceed to Phase 1 with
   the research agents.

● Now I'll invoke the 3 research agents in parallel to
  investigate different aspects of the nvim/docs/
  directory refactor:
