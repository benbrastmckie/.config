> /coordinate is running… research what minimal changes can be made to the .claude/docs/ and other README.md files in .claude/ 
in order to make the formatting changes implemented by the plan /home/benjamin/.config/.claude/specs/510_coordinate_error_and_f
ormatting_improvements/plans/002_coordinate_remaining_formatting_improvements.md clear to see, creating a plan to refactor the 
documentation accordingly. I want to avoid historical language in the docs about changes or past versions to clearly articulate
 the present state of the implementation only. I also want to avoid redundancy or creating excessive files that are unnecessary
 and hard to navigate and maintain, so make minimal changes only to work with and improve existing documentation. 
  ⎿  Allowed 4 tools for this command

● I'll help you research and plan minimal documentation changes to reflect the formatting improvements in the /coordinate
  command. Let me start by creating a todo list for this workflow.

● Now let me execute the /coordinate workflow for this research-and-plan task.

● Bash(pwd)
  ⎿  /home/benjamin/.config

● Bash(WORKFLOW_DESCRIPTION="research what minimal changes can be made to the .claude/docs/ and other README.md files in

● Perfect! The workflow is detected as research-and-plan, which means we'll execute Phases 0-2 (Location, Research,
  Planning).

● Bash(# Source workflow initialization library

● Now let me move to Phase 1 and invoke research agents in parallel to analyze the plan changes and current documentation
  state.

● Now I'll invoke research agents in parallel to analyze the plan changes and documentation requirements. Let me prepare
  for Phase 1 research.

● Excellent! Both research reports have been created successfully. Now let me verify they exist and then move to Phase 2 to
   create the implementation plan.

● Bash(echo "Verifying research reports (2): "

● Perfect! The /coordinate workflow is complete. Let me provide you with a summary:

  ✅ Workflow Complete: research-and-plan

  Artifacts Created:

  1. Research Reports (2 files):
    - 001_analysis_of_plan_002_formatting_changes_and_their.md - Analyzes the formatting improvements implemented in Plan
  002 (Phases 0-4)
    - 002_current_documentation_structure_in_claudedocs_and_.md - Maps current documentation structure and identifies
  redundancy/historical language
  2. Implementation Plan (1 file):
    - 001_minimal_documentation_changes_for_coordinate_forma.md - 3-phase plan (4-5 hours estimated) for minimal
  documentation updates

  Plan Details:
  - Phases: 3
  - Complexity: Medium (35.5 score)
  - Estimated Time: 4-5 hours

  Location: /home/benjamin/.config/.claude/specs/515_research_what_minimal_changes_can_be_made_to_the_c/

  Next Steps:

  To implement the documentation changes, run:
  /implement /home/benjamin/.config/.claude/specs/515_research_what_minimal_changes_can_be_made_to_the_c/plans/001_minimal_
  documentation_changes_for_coordinate_forma.md

  The plan focuses on minimal changes to existing documentation files, removing historical language, eliminating
  redundancy, and clearly documenting the current state of /coordinate's formatting features (workflow scope detection,
  concise verification, progress markers, silent libraries, and fail-fast error handling).
