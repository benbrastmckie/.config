# Coordinate Output

## Compact Details

> /coordinate is running… the plan 
/home/benjamin/.config/.claude/specs/547_coordinat
  e_agent_invocation_fix/plans/001_fix_coordinate_agent_invo
cations.md
  appears to have fixed what was a vexed issue in the 
/coordinate command
  where it was not running. Without adding needless 
commentary or
  historical remarks about changes made or hurtles overcome,
 research
  what could be improved in .claude/docs/ and 
.claude/commands/README.md
  to clarify how commands are to be structured so as to 
ensure
  functionality. Create and implement a plan to revise the 
documentation
  accordingly. 
  ⎿  Allowed 4 tools for this command

● I'll coordinate a workflow to research documentation
  improvements and implement revisions to clarify
  command structure requirements.
