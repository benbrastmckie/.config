> /coordinate is running… research the 
/home/benjamin/.config/nvim/docs/ directory in order to plan
 and implement a refactor of this directory, keeping track 
of all references to these files from elsewhere in the 
repository and creating a README.md which documents the 
contents of this directory. The aim is to provide well 
organized documentation with good cross linking and minimal 
repetition.

  Workflow Summary

  Scope: research-and-plan (Phases 0-2)

  Phase 1: Research ✓

  Created 3 comprehensive research reports:
  1. Current structure and content - Analyzed 18
  markdown files (9,496 lines) in nvim/docs/
  2. External references - Found 132+ references across
  48 files in the repository
  3. Organization best practices - Reviewed project
  documentation standards

  Phase 2: Planning ✓

  Created a 6-phase implementation plan for refactoring
  the nvim/docs/ directory

  Key Findings

  - The nvim/docs/ directory is well-organized with 18
  documentation files
  - 132+ external references exist across the repository
  - Current documentation follows present-state
  philosophy consistently
  - Plan includes tracking all references and creating a
   comprehensive README.md

  Next Steps

  To execute the refactoring plan:

  /implement /home/benjamin/.config/.claude/specs/586_re
  search_the_homebenjaminconfignvimdocs_directory_/plans
  /001_implementation.md

  The implementation plan will guide you through
  reorganizing the documentation, updating all
  references, creating the README.md, and ensuring
  minimal repetition with good cross-linking.
