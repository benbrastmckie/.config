> /coordinate is running… I have significantly refactored the /coordinate command in .claude/commands/
 and want to research what changes should be made to make /orchestrate (a slightly heavier version) 
follow similar patterns (currently /orchestrate does not work). Please also research 
/home/benjamin/.config/.claude/specs/517_console_output_formatting_best_practices_for_claud/reports/00
1_console_output_formatting_best_practices_for_claud/OVERVIEW.md to see what improvements could be 
made to /orchestrate, creating a plan that I can review.

● I'll research the refactored /coordinate command patterns and console output best practices,
  then create a plan to fix and improve /orchestrate.

● Now I'll invoke the /coordinate command to handle this research and planning workflow:

> /coordinate is running… "research the refactored /coordinate command patterns, console output 
formatting best practices from spec 517, and /orchestrate current implementation issues to create a 
comprehensive improvement plan for /orchestrate"
