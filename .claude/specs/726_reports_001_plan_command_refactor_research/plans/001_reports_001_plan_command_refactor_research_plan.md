## Overview

The /plan command currently exists as a 230-line pseudocode template with comprehensive documentation but no executable implementation. This refactor will transform it into a production-grade command following proven robustness patterns from optimize-claude while avoiding the complexity pitfalls identified in coordinate.

The refactored command will:
1. Execute feature description analysis using LLM classification pattern
2. Conditionally delegate research for complex features (complexity ≥7 or architecture keywords)
3. Generate implementation plans using plan-architect agent with behavioral injection
4. Validate plans against project standards
5. Provide fail-fast verification at every stage
6. Maintain absolute path discipline and idempotent operations

## Research Summary

**Key Findings from Research Reports**:

1. **Coordinate Fragility** (Report 001): 2,466-line command evolved through 13 failed refactor attempts (Nov 4-6, 2025), suffers from subprocess isolation constraints requiring stateless recalculation across 6+ bash blocks, 50+ verification checkpoints, and 400-line code transformation bugs. Complexity stems from fighting Claude Code Bash tool execution model.

2. **Optimize-Claude Robustness** (Report 002): Five-layer architectural pattern achieves near-perfect reliability: (1) fail-fast verification after every stage, (2) agent behavioral injection with 28+ completion criteria, (3) library integration for proven algorithms, (4) lazy directory creation, (5) comprehensive test coverage. "Create file FIRST, analyze LATER" pattern ensures deliverables exist even if errors occur.

3. **Current Plan Implementation** (Report 003): Command is pseudocode documentation, not executable code. Missing core functions: analyze_feature_description(), extract_requirements(), validate-plan.sh, extract-standards.sh. Libraries exist (plan-core-bundle.sh, complexity-utils.sh) but orchestration is incomplete.

4. **Context Preservation** (Report 004): State-persistence.sh (GitHub Actions pattern) achieves 70% performance improvement (50ms → 15ms), metadata-extraction.sh provides 50-word summaries, context-pruning.sh achieves 95% reduction. Pre-calculated artifact paths eliminate subagent overhead.

**Standards Compliance Requirements** (from .claude/docs/):

5. **Command Architecture Standards**: Commands MUST use imperative language (YOU MUST, EXECUTE NOW, MANDATORY) for critical operations. Standard 14 requires executable/documentation separation: executable target <250 lines (simple commands), comprehensive guide unlimited. Standard 11 requires imperative agent invocation with explicit execution markers.

6. **Behavioral Injection Pattern**: Path pre-calculation BEFORE agent invocation, context injection via file content (not SlashCommand), metadata-only passing (95% context reduction). NO command-to-command invocation via SlashCommand. Standard 12 requires structural/behavioral content separation.

7. **Library Sourcing Order** (Standard 15): Source state machine foundation FIRST, then error handling BEFORE verification checkpoints. Source guards enable safe re-sourcing. Specific order: workflow-state-machine.sh → state-persistence.sh → error-handling.sh → verification-helpers.sh.

8. **Testing Protocols**: Test location `.claude/tests/`, pattern `test_*.sh`, coverage ≥80% for modified code. Test isolation using `CLAUDE_SPECS_ROOT="/tmp/test_specs_$$"` override. Cleanup traps mandatory.

**Recommended Approach**:
- Follow optimize-claude's fail-fast verification pattern, NOT coordinate's complexity
- Apply Standard 14: Separate executable (<250 lines) from comprehensive guide
- Use imperative language (EXECUTE NOW, YOU MUST) for all critical operations (Standard 0)
- Implement behavioral injection with mandatory file creation protocol (Standard 11)
- Leverage existing libraries with correct sourcing order (Standard 15)
- Add comprehensive validation with validate-plan.sh
- Maintain absolute path discipline with CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR detection (Standard 13)
- Apply metadata-only passing for 95% context reduction
- Support progressive expansion (all plans start Level 0, expand on-demand)

### Component Design

**1. Feature Analysis (LLM Classification)**
- Use Task tool with haiku-4 model for fast classification (<5 seconds)
- Analysis criteria: complexity keywords, scope indicators, technical depth
- Return structured JSON for deterministic downstream logic
- Cache results to avoid re-analysis on retries

**2. Research Delegation**
- Triggers: complexity ≥7 OR keywords (integrate, migrate, refactor, architecture)
- Generate 1-4 research topics from feature description
- Use research-specialist agent with behavioral injection
- Pre-calculate report paths using topic-based numbering
- Extract metadata (50-word summaries) for plan context
- Verify reports created with fail-fast checkpoints

**3. Plan-Architect Agent Invocation**
- Source plan-architect.md behavioral file
- Pass workflow-specific context: feature, reports, standards, path
- Behavioral protocol enforces: create plan file FIRST, analyze LATER
- Verify 42 completion criteria before return
- Return structured signal: PLAN_CREATED: [absolute-path]

**4. Validation Library (validate-plan.sh)**
- Check metadata completeness (8 required fields)
- Validate standards references (CLAUDE.md path, code standards, testing protocols)
- Verify test phases present (if Testing Protocols defined in CLAUDE.md)
- Verify documentation tasks exist (if Documentation Policy defined)
- Validate phase dependencies (no circular deps)
- Generate validation report with warnings/errors

**5. Expansion Evaluation (Post-Validation)**
- Invoke complexity-estimator agent to analyze all phases in created plan
- Agent evaluates each phase using context-aware analysis (not just task count)
- Complexity threshold: ≥8 triggers expansion recommendation
- Decision logic:
  - **No phases ≥8**: Present basic plan outline (phase names, objectives, paths) and complete
  - **One or more phases ≥8**: Invoke plan-structure-manager agents in parallel
- Parallel expansion: Use single-message invocation for 60-80% time savings
- Verify expanded phase files created at pre-calculated paths (fail-fast)
- Update plan metadata: Structure Level 0→1, Expanded Phases list
- Follows /expand command patterns (see .claude/commands/expand.md)

### Error Handling Strategy

**Fail-Fast Verification Pattern** (from optimize-claude):
```bash
# After every critical operation
if [ ! -f "$ARTIFACT_PATH" ]; then
  echo "ERROR: Agent N (agent-name) failed to create artifact: $ARTIFACT_PATH"
  echo "This is a critical failure. Check agent logs above."
  exit 1
fi
```

**Absolute Path Validation** (at entry point):
```bash
if [[ ! "$REPORT_PATH" =~ ^/ ]]; then
  echo "ERROR: REPORT_PATH must be absolute: $REPORT_PATH"
  exit 1
fi
```

**Idempotent Operations**:
```bash
# Lazy directory creation (safe to run multiple times)
ensure_artifact_directory "$PLAN_PATH" || exit 1

# Atomic state persistence
append_workflow_state "PLAN_PATH" "$PLAN_PATH"
verify_state_variable "PLAN_PATH" || exit 1
```

- [ ] **Standard 16**: YOU MUST verify library sourcing: `if ! source .claude/lib/validate-plan.sh 2>&1; then fail_fast "validate-plan.sh library not found"; fi`
- [x] **EXECUTE NOW**: Invoke validate_plan() on created plan (file: .claude/commands/plan.md, lines 231-250)
- [x] **Standard 16**: YOU MUST verify validation return code: `if ! report=$(validate_plan "$PLAN_PATH" "$STANDARDS_FILE" 2>&1); then echo "CRITICAL: Plan validation failed"; exit 1; fi`
- [x] **EXECUTE NOW**: Parse validation report JSON using jq: `WARNINGS=$(echo "$report" | jq -r '.warnings | length'); ERRORS=$(echo "$report" | jq -r '.errors | length')`
- [x] **YOU MUST**: Display validation warnings to user (non-blocking, informational with severity levels)
- [x] **Standard 0 - MANDATORY**: YOU MUST fail-fast on validation errors: `if [ "$ERROR_COUNT" -gt 0 ]; then echo "Plan validation found $ERROR_COUNT critical errors. Fix before proceeding."; exit 1; fi`
- [x] **EXECUTE NOW**: Verify metadata completeness (8 required fields: Date, Feature, Scope, Phases, Hours, Structure Level, Complexity, Standards)
- [x] **EXECUTE NOW**: Verify standards references (CLAUDE.md path present, Standard N references included, code standards section exists, testing protocols referenced)

- [x] **Standard 12 Compliance**: Task prompt format: "Read and follow: .claude/agents/plan-structure-manager.md\n\n**Workflow-Specific Context**:\n- Plan Path: $PLAN_PATH\n- Phase Number: $PHASE_NUM\n- Expanded Phase File: $PHASE_FILE (pre-calculated)\n\nExecute per behavioral guidelines. Return: PHASE_EXPANDED: $PHASE_FILE"
- [x] **EXECUTE NOW**: Invoke plan-structure-manager agents in parallel for flagged phases using single-message multi-Task pattern (40-60% time savings)
- [x] **Standard 0 - MANDATORY**: YOU MUST verify EACH expanded phase: `if [ ! -f "$PHASE_FILE" ]; then echo "CRITICAL: Agent plan-structure-manager failed to create: $PHASE_FILE"; exit 1; fi`
- [x] **EXECUTE NOW**: Update plan metadata section with Structure Level (0→1) and Expanded Phases list
- [x] **YOU MUST**: Follow /expand command patterns for consistency (reference .claude/commands/expand.md for structural templates)

## Testing Requirements (Per Testing Protocols)

### Test Location and Naming
- **Test file**: `/home/benjamin/.config/.claude/tests/test_plan_command.sh`
- **Pattern**: Follow `test_*.sh` convention
- **Coverage target**: ≥80% for all modified code

### Test Isolation
- Use `CLAUDE_SPECS_ROOT="/tmp/test_specs_$$"` environment variable override
- Cleanup trap: `trap cleanup EXIT` to remove test artifacts
- Pre-test validation: Verify empty directory before tests
- Post-test validation: Verify no production pollution

### Test Cases Required
1. **Argument Parsing Tests**:
   - Single-word feature description
   - Multi-word quoted feature description
   - Absolute path validation (reject relative paths)
   - Help flag display

2. **Feature Analysis Tests**:
   - Low complexity (≤6): no research delegation
   - High complexity (≥7): research delegation triggered
   - Architecture keywords: research delegation triggered
   - Task tool failure: fallback to heuristic analysis

3. **Standards Compliance Tests**:
   - Library sourcing order verification
   - CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR detection (not BASH_SOURCE)
   - Return code verification for critical functions
   - Imperative language pattern validation

4. **Agent Invocation Tests**:
   - Research agents: verify report files created

   - Complexity-estimator: verify phase analysis
   - Parallel invocation: verify time savings

5. **Validation Tests**:
   - Metadata completeness (8 required fields)
   - Standards compliance (CLAUDE.md referenced)
   - Phase dependency validation (no circular deps)

6. **Integration Tests**:
   - End-to-end: feature description → plan created
   - With research reports: verify metadata extracted
   - Expansion evaluation: verify conditional expansion

### Automated Validation Scripts
- Run `validate_executable_doc_separation.sh` to verify:
  - Executable file size <250 lines (Standard 14)
  - Guide file exists and is comprehensive
  - Cross-references bidirectional

- Run `.claude/lib/validate-agent-invocation-pattern.sh` to verify:
  - Imperative patterns present (EXECUTE NOW, YOU MUST)
  - No YAML/JSON wrappers around Task invocations
  - No code-fenced Task examples

## Documentation Requirements

### Command Guide Updates (Standard 14)
- Comprehensive guide exists: `/home/benjamin/.config/.claude/docs/guides/plan-command-guide.md`
- Update with:
  - Usage examples (simple features, complex features, with research reports)
  - Feature analysis criteria (complexity triggers, keyword matching)
  - Research delegation workflow
  - Plan validation process
  - Standards compliance requirements
  - Troubleshooting section
- Bidirectional cross-reference: executable → guide, guide → executable

### CLAUDE.md Updates
- Add /plan command reference to command catalog
- Document research delegation triggers
- Document validation requirements
- Reference standards compliance (Standards 0, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16)

### Inline Documentation
- Comprehensive comments explaining patterns
- References to standards (Standard N) for design rationale
- References to research reports for architectural decisions
- Examples of correct usage (NOT code-fenced Task examples)

### Agent Behavioral Files
- Ensure agent files exist:
  - `.claude/agents/research-specialist.md`
  - `.claude/agents/plan-architect.md`
  - `.claude/agents/complexity-estimator.md`
  - `.claude/agents/plan-structure-manager.md`
- No inline duplication (reference files, don't duplicate procedures)

## Dependencies

### External Dependencies
- Claude AI API (Task tool, haiku-4 model)
- jq (JSON parsing)
- bash 4.0+ (associative arrays)

### Internal Dependencies
- `/home/benjamin/.config/.claude/lib/unified-location-detection.sh` - Directory discovery
- `/home/benjamin/.config/.claude/lib/state-persistence.sh` - State management
- `/home/benjamin/.config/.claude/lib/metadata-extraction.sh` - Report metadata

## Risk Management

### Technical Risks

**Risk 1: LLM Classification Unreliable**
- Mitigation: Implement fallback heuristic analysis if Task tool fails
- Fallback: Keyword matching + length-based complexity estimation

**Risk 2: Agent Failures**
- Mitigation: Fail-fast verification after every agent invocation
- Recovery: Clear error messages with diagnostic hints

**Risk 3: Code Transformation Bugs (400-line limit)**
- Mitigation: Keep command under 300 lines (100-line safety margin)
- Detection: Add file size check to test suite

**Risk 4: Subprocess Isolation Issues**
- Mitigation: Use single bash script execution (not multi-block coordination)
- Avoidance: Don't follow coordinate's multi-block pattern

**Risk 5: Path Calculation Errors**
- Mitigation: Pre-calculate all paths in command, verify absolute
- Validation: Entry point path validation (fail immediately)

### Process Risks

**Risk 1: Scope Creep**
- Mitigation: Follow research recommendations strictly
- Boundary: No multi-block coordination, no hierarchical supervision

**Risk 2: Integration Failures**
- Mitigation: Comprehensive integration testing with real feature descriptions
- Detection: Test suite runs full workflow end-to-end

### Rollback Procedure

If any phase fails or validation errors occur:

```bash
# Restore from backup (if changes were committed)
git log --oneline -10  # Find last good commit
git revert <commit-hash>

# Or reset to last stable state
git reset --hard <last-stable-commit>

# Verify restoration
git status
/plan --help  # Should display help text
```

**When to Rollback**:
- Validation fails in Phase N+1
- Tests fail after implementation
- Command exceeds 400 lines (code transformation risk)
- Agent invocation patterns break

## Notes

**Complexity Calculation Details**:
```
Score = (tasks × 1.0) + (phases × 5.0) + (hours × 0.5) + (dependencies × 2.0)
Score = (52 × 1.0) + (6 × 5.0) + (20 × 0.5) + (4 × 2.0)
Score = 52 + 30 + 10 + 8 = 100

Adjusted for research integration complexity: 100 × 1.275 = 127.5
```

**Why Level 0 Structure**:
- Complexity score 127.5 suggests Level 1 (threshold: 50-200)
- Starting with Level 0 per progressive planning best practice
- Can expand to Level 1 if implementation reveals need

**Expansion Hint**:
If implementation complexity increases during execution, consider using `/expand` to break phases into separate files for better organization.

**Design Rationale**:
This plan avoids coordinate's complexity (2,466 lines, 13 failed refactors, subprocess isolation constraints) and follows optimize-claude's robustness patterns (fail-fast verification, behavioral injection, library integration, lazy directory creation, comprehensive testing).

- Validation script automation needed

## Revision History

- **2025-11-16** (Revision 5): Critical standards compliance gaps addressed based on gap analysis research. Key changes: (1) Added Phase 0 for orchestrator pattern compliance - establishes orchestrator role, pre-calculates ALL artifact paths before agent invocations, sources libraries in correct order per Standard 15. (2) Transformed all task language to imperative (EXECUTE NOW, YOU MUST) per Standards 0 and 11. (3) Added explicit Standard 12 compliance examples showing behavioral injection pattern: "Read and follow: .claude/agents/[name].md" with metadata-only context, NO inline procedure duplication. (4) Added Standard 14 executable size monitoring to Phase 6 validation (<250 line target). (5) Expanded Standard 16 application to ALL critical functions, not just library sourcing. (6) Added fail-fast design decision documentation (no placeholder creation by orchestrator). (7) Added fallback heuristic algorithm specification for Phase 2 LLM classification. (8) Updated all phase dependencies to reference Phase 0. (9) Increased estimated phases 7→8, hours 16-20→17-21. This revision eliminates the most critical compliance gaps: behavioral content duplication (Gap 1), missing imperative execution markers (Gap 2), and missing Phase 0 for orchestrator pattern (Gap 7).
- **2025-11-16** (Revision 4): Standards compliance integration. Researched comprehensive .claude/docs/ standards and integrated compliance requirements throughout all phases. Key additions: (1) Research Summary expanded with 8 standards compliance requirements including Standard 14 (executable/doc separation <250 lines), Standard 0 (imperative language), Standards 11-12 (behavioral injection), Standard 15 (library sourcing order), Standard 16 (return code verification). (2) Success Criteria expanded with explicit standard compliance checkpoints and anti-pattern prevention. (3) Phase tasks updated with standard-specific implementation requirements (Standard N tags). (4) New Testing Requirements section added with test isolation, coverage targets (≥80%), and automated validation scripts. (5) Documentation Requirements expanded with Standard 14 compliance (bidirectional cross-references, no inline agent duplication). This revision ensures implementation will comply with all established architectural standards, avoiding anti-patterns like documentation-only YAML blocks, command-to-command invocation, and code-fenced Task examples.
- **2025-11-16** (Revision 3): Removed Phase 8 (Testing and Documentation). Recognized that /plan command only creates plans, not implements them. Testing and documentation are concerns for the implementation phase (when someone uses /implement), not plan creation phase. Reduced from 8 to 7 phases, estimated hours 16-20. The command now completes after Phase 7 (Expansion Evaluation), presenting either a basic plan outline or an expanded plan structure.
- **2025-11-16** (Revision 2): Restructured phases to separate concerns. Split original Phase 6 into three distinct phases: Phase 6 (Plan Validation - validates plan against standards), Phase 7 (Expansion Evaluation - conditionally expands complex phases using complexity-estimator agent), and Phase 8 (Testing and Documentation). This separation improves clarity, allows validation to complete before expansion decisions, and makes expansion truly optional based on complexity analysis. Total phases increased from 6 to 8, estimated hours 21-26.
- **2025-11-16** (Revision 1): Added expansion evaluation logic to Phase 6. After plan validation, command will invoke complexity-estimator agent to analyze all phases for expansion needs (threshold: complexity ≥8). If no expansion needed, presents basic plan outline and completes. If expansion needed, invokes plan-structure-manager agents in parallel for flagged phases. This follows patterns from /expand command to ensure complex phases receive detailed specifications.
