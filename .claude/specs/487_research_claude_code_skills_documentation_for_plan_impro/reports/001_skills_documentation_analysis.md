# Skills Documentation Analysis for Plan Improvement

## Metadata
- **Created**: 2025-10-26
- **Source**: https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/skills
- **Purpose**: Analyze official Skills documentation to identify improvements for spec 075 skills integration plan
- **Compliance**: .claude/docs/concepts/writing-standards.md

## Executive Summary

The official Claude Code Skills documentation reveals several architectural patterns and best practices that differ from assumptions in the current skills integration plan (spec 075). The most significant finding is that **Skills are model-invoked** (Claude autonomously decides when to use them) rather than explicitly invoked like commands. This fundamental difference requires adjustments to Phase 1 (registry design), Phase 4 (skill creation approach), and overall integration strategy.

**Key Recommendation**: Shift focus from enforcement-style skills to capability-extension skills with well-engineered descriptions that enable autonomous activation.

## 1. Skills Definition & Architectural Differences

### What Skills Are

**Official Definition**: Modular capabilities packaged in discoverable folders containing a `SKILL.md` file with instructions, plus optional supporting files (scripts, templates, documentation).

**Critical Distinction from Commands**:
> "Skills are **model-invoked**—Claude autonomously decides when to use them based on your request and the Skill's description. This is different from slash commands, which are **user-invoked** (you explicitly type `/command` to trigger them)."

### Implications for Current Plan

**Current Plan Assumption** (Phase 4, line 327-328):
- Creates "Custom Meta-Level Enforcement Skills" for standards enforcement
- Implies explicit invocation model similar to commands

**Conflict**:
The model-invoked nature of Skills makes them unsuitable for deterministic enforcement. Skills work best for:
- Expert guidance (code quality advice, test strategy suggestions)
- Workflow augmentation (form filling, document conversion)
- Contextual assistance (debugging methodologies, architectural patterns)

**Recommendation**:
- Reframe Phase 4 skills as "guidance and methodology" rather than "enforcement"
- Rely on pre-commit hooks and unified libraries for deterministic enforcement
- Update skill descriptions to include specific activation triggers

**Current Plan Already Addresses This Partially** (Phase 4, line 335-336):
> "Skills excel at providing guidance and making context-aware decisions, not enforcing deterministic rules. Deterministic enforcement (indentation, line length, timeless writing) belongs in unified libraries and pre-commit hooks."

**Action**: Strengthen this distinction throughout the plan and add explicit guidance on writing activation triggers.

## 2. Skills Architecture & Storage Locations

### Three-Tier Storage System

**Official Specification**:
1. **Personal Skills**: `~/.claude/skills/` (individual workflows)
2. **Project Skills**: `.claude/skills/` (team-shared, git-managed)
3. **Plugin Skills**: Bundled within plugins for distribution

### Current Plan Coverage

**Phase 1 (line 147-148)**: Correctly identifies directory structure
> "- Main directories: `converters/`, `analyzers/`, `enforcers/`, `integrations/`"

**Gap Identified**:
- Plan proposes subdirectory organization (`converters/`, `enforcers/`) but official docs show flat skill-name directories
- No mention of personal vs project vs plugin distinction
- No guidance on when to use each storage tier

**Official Structure**:
```
.claude/skills/
├── skill-name-1/
│   └── SKILL.md
├── skill-name-2/
│   ├── SKILL.md
│   └── supporting-files/
```

**Current Plan Structure** (implied):
```
.claude/skills/
├── enforcers/
│   ├── code-standards-guidance/
│   │   └── SKILL.md
```

**Recommendation**:
- Update Phase 1 directory structure to match official flat organization
- Add guidance on project skills vs personal skills distinction
- Document when to use category subdirectories (if at all) vs flat structure

**Rationale**: The official flat structure simplifies discovery and aligns with "one Skill per focused capability" principle.

## 3. SKILL.md Frontmatter Requirements

### Official Specification

**Required Fields**:
- `name`: lowercase letters, numbers, hyphens only (max 64 characters)
- `description`: brief description including what it does AND when to use it (max 1024 characters)

**Optional Fields**:
- `allowed-tools`: Restrict available tools (e.g., `Read, Grep, Glob`)

**Critical Insight**: Description must include BOTH capability AND activation triggers.

### Current Plan Coverage

**Phase 0 (line 53-57)**:
> "1. Create skill definition template in `.claude/templates/skill-definition-template.md`
>    - Follow agent definition format with frontmatter
>    - Include sections: Core Capabilities, Standards Compliance, Behavioral Guidelines, Expected Input/Output"

**Gaps Identified**:
1. No mention of `name` field constraints (lowercase, hyphens, max 64 chars)
2. No mention of `description` field requirements (max 1024 chars, must include activation triggers)
3. No mention of `allowed-tools` optional field for permission restriction
4. Template proposes "agent definition format" but Skills have different frontmatter requirements

**Recommendation**:
- Update Phase 0 template creation to include Skills-specific frontmatter:
  ```yaml
  ---
  name: code-standards-guidance
  description: Provides guidance on code organization, naming conventions, and error handling patterns. Use when editing code files or discussing code quality, especially for subjective decisions like architecture and design patterns.
  allowed-tools: Read, Edit
  ---
  ```
- Add validation in Phase 0 task 5 (pre-commit hooks) to check:
  - `name` matches lowercase/hyphen/number pattern and ≤64 chars
  - `description` exists and ≤1024 chars
  - `description` includes both capability and activation trigger language
  - `allowed-tools` if specified uses valid tool names

## 4. Description Engineering for Activation

### Critical Success Factor

**Official Guidance**:
> "Write specific descriptions...Include both what the Skill does and when Claude should use it...with key terms users would mention."

**Example Progression**:
- ❌ Too vague: "Helps with documents"
- ✅ Specific: "Extract text/tables from PDFs, fill forms, merge documents. Use when working with PDF files or mentioning PDFs, forms, or document extraction."

### Current Plan Gaps

**Phase 4 (lines 339-347)**: Code-standards-guidance skill
- Task describes capability: "Provide guidance on code organization, naming conventions, error handling patterns"
- **Missing**: Activation triggers (when should Claude invoke this skill?)

**Recommended Description** (Phase 4 update):
```yaml
description: Provides guidance on code organization, naming conventions, and error handling patterns for subjective quality decisions. Use when editing or reviewing code files, discussing architectural choices, or asking about code structure and design patterns. Do not use for deterministic formatting (indentation, line length) which are handled by pre-commit hooks.
```

**Phase 4 (lines 349-356)**: Testing-protocols-guidance skill
- Similar issue: describes capability but not activation triggers

**Recommended Description** (Phase 4 update):
```yaml
description: Provides strategic guidance on test coverage, test patterns for edge cases, and integration vs unit test approaches. Use when writing tests, discussing test strategy, or analyzing test suite completeness. Coverage threshold enforcement is handled by test runners.
```

### Action Items for Phase 4

1. Update all skill creation tasks to include "Description Engineering" section
2. Require descriptions to explicitly state:
   - What the skill does (capabilities)
   - When Claude should activate it (triggers)
   - What it does NOT do (boundaries)
3. Add testing step: "Verify skill activates for expected queries and does not activate for out-of-scope queries"

## 5. Progressive Disclosure & Context Management

### Official Pattern

**Key Insight**:
> "Claude reads these files only when needed, using progressive disclosure to manage context efficiently."

Supporting files aren't loaded until required, minimizing context overhead.

### Current Plan Alignment

**Phase 1 (lines 148-150)**: Supports optional files
> "- Each skill in subdirectory: `skill-name/SKILL.md`
>  - Support for optional files: `reference.md`, `scripts/`, `templates/`"

**Strong Alignment**: Plan already anticipates multi-file Skills with optional supporting files.

**Recommendation**:
- Add note in Phase 1 about progressive disclosure benefit
- Update Phase 6 documentation task to include guidance on when to split Skills into multiple files (use single-file Skills until supporting files are clearly needed)

## 6. Skills Registry Design Implications

### Discovery Mechanism

**Official Specification**: Claude automatically discovers Skills from three storage locations:
1. `~/.claude/skills/` (personal)
2. `.claude/skills/` (project)
3. Plugin-provided Skills

**No Explicit Registry File Mentioned**: Discovery appears to be filesystem-based, not metadata-file-based.

### Current Plan Approach

**Phase 1 (line 122)**: Proposes extending agent-registry-utils.sh
> "1. Extend skills registry system in `.claude/lib/agent-registry-utils.sh` to support skills"

**Questions for Consideration**:
1. Does Skills system require a registry file (like agent-registry.json)?
2. Or does discovery work via filesystem scanning?
3. Is the registry only for tooling (validation, listing) rather than runtime discovery?

**Recommendation**:
- Clarify registry purpose in Phase 1: Is it for Claude's discovery or for CLI tooling?
- If official Skills use filesystem discovery, registry may be optional (for `/plugin list` style commands)
- Consider whether extending agent-registry-utils.sh creates unnecessary coupling

**Potential Simplified Approach** (if registry is optional):
- Phase 1 creates utility functions for validation and listing (not runtime discovery)
- Skills discovered via filesystem scan (matching official behavior)
- Registry file optional for metadata caching (performance optimization)

## 7. Comparison with Current Plan Phases

### Phase 0: Planning and Documentation Foundation

**Status**: Well-aligned with official docs

**Improvement Opportunities**:
1. Update skill definition template to match official frontmatter requirements (name, description, allowed-tools)
2. Add description engineering guidance (capability + activation triggers)
3. Include validation for name constraints (lowercase, hyphens, max 64 chars)

### Phase 1: Skills Registry Infrastructure

**Status**: Partially aligned, needs clarification

**Questions**:
1. Is `skills-registry.sh` extension of agent-registry-utils.sh necessary?
2. Can Skills discovery work via filesystem scanning (matching official behavior)?

**Improvement Opportunities**:
1. Clarify registry purpose (runtime discovery vs CLI tooling)
2. Consider simpler filesystem-based discovery if registry is optional
3. Reduce coupling with agent-registry-utils.sh if Skills discovery is independent

### Phase 2: obra/superpowers Integration

**Status**: Well-aligned

**No Changes Needed**: Phase 2 correctly references external Skills via plugin system.

### Phase 3: Anthropic Document Skills Integration

**Status**: Well-aligned

**No Changes Needed**: Phase 3 correctly uses plugin installation pattern.

### Phase 4: Custom Meta-Level Enforcement Skills

**Status**: Needs significant updates

**Critical Issues**:
1. "Enforcement" framing conflicts with model-invoked nature of Skills
2. Skill descriptions lack activation triggers
3. Missing guidance on description engineering

**Improvement Opportunities**:
1. Rename: "Custom Meta-Level Enforcement Skills" → "Custom Guidance Skills"
2. Add description engineering section with activation trigger examples
3. Update all skill descriptions to include:
   - Capability statement
   - Activation triggers (when to use)
   - Boundaries (when NOT to use)
4. Add testing task: Verify Skills activate for expected queries
5. Document relationship between Skills (guidance) and libraries/hooks (enforcement)

### Phase 5: Command Integration and Agent Migration

**Status**: Needs updates for Skills invocation model

**Current Approach** (line 396-397):
> "- Add skills availability notation in behavioral prompts
>  - Document which skills auto-activate during implementation"

**Question**: Do commands need to "document" Skills availability, or do Skills activate autonomously regardless of command context?

**Recommendation**:
- Clarify whether command behavioral prompts need Skills references
- If Skills activate autonomously, command integration may be documentation-only (not behavioral changes)
- Test whether Skills activate during command execution without explicit references

### Phase 6: Validation, Optimization, and Documentation

**Status**: Well-aligned

**Improvement Opportunities**:
1. Add activation testing: "Verify Skills activate for expected queries"
2. Add description quality validation
3. Document progressive disclosure benefits in architecture documentation

## 8. Recommendations Summary

### High-Priority Changes

1. **Phase 0 - Template Updates**:
   - Update skill definition template with official frontmatter fields (name, description, allowed-tools)
   - Add description engineering guidance (capability + activation triggers + boundaries)
   - Add name constraint validation (lowercase, hyphens, max 64 chars)

2. **Phase 1 - Registry Clarification**:
   - Clarify registry purpose (runtime discovery vs CLI tooling)
   - Consider filesystem-based discovery to match official behavior
   - Evaluate whether agent-registry-utils.sh extension is necessary

3. **Phase 4 - Description Engineering**:
   - Rename "Custom Meta-Level Enforcement Skills" → "Custom Guidance Skills"
   - Add description engineering section with activation trigger examples
   - Update all skill task descriptions to include activation triggers
   - Add testing task: Verify Skills activate for expected queries

4. **Phase 4 - Skill Descriptions**:
   - code-standards-guidance: Add activation triggers for code editing/review
   - testing-protocols-guidance: Add activation triggers for test writing/strategy
   - Document boundaries (what Skills do NOT do)

### Medium-Priority Changes

5. **Phase 1 - Directory Structure**:
   - Evaluate flat skill-name/ structure vs categorized subdirectories
   - Document rationale if keeping subdirectories (official docs show flat structure)

6. **Phase 5 - Command Integration**:
   - Clarify whether commands need Skills references in behavioral prompts
   - Test autonomous activation during command execution
   - Update integration approach based on testing results

7. **Phase 6 - Validation**:
   - Add activation testing to validation suite
   - Add description quality checks (capability + triggers present)
   - Document progressive disclosure benefits

### Low-Priority Enhancements

8. **Phase 1 - Storage Tiers**:
   - Document personal vs project vs plugin Skills distinction
   - Add guidance on when to use each storage tier

9. **Phase 6 - Documentation**:
   - Add guidance on when to use single-file vs multi-file Skills
   - Document progressive disclosure pattern for supporting files

## 9. Standards Compliance Check

### Timeless Writing Compliance

**Verified**: This report uses present-tense language ("Skills are model-invoked") rather than temporal markers ("Skills were recently changed to be model-invoked").

**Status**: ✅ Compliant with .claude/docs/concepts/writing-standards.md

### Command Architecture Standards

**Applicability**: Skills are not commands, so command architecture standards do not directly apply.

**Relevant Pattern**: Description engineering for activation triggers parallels behavioral injection patterns (context-aware invocation).

## 10. Integration with Existing Plan

### Changes Required vs Changes Recommended

**Changes Required** (breaks functionality):
1. Phase 0: Update frontmatter template to match official spec (prevents validation failures)
2. Phase 4: Add activation triggers to descriptions (prevents Skills from activating)

**Changes Recommended** (improves quality):
1. Phase 1: Clarify registry approach (reduces unnecessary complexity)
2. Phase 4: Rename "enforcement" to "guidance" (aligns with model-invoked nature)
3. All phases: Add activation testing (ensures Skills work as intended)

### Implementation Approach

**Option 1: In-Place Updates** (recommended)
- Update spec 075 plan directly with improvements
- Add "Updated 2025-10-26 based on official docs research" to revision history
- Maintain existing phase structure

**Option 2: Supplemental Document**
- Create "Skills Integration Addendum" with official docs insights
- Reference from spec 075 plan
- Implement improvements during Phase 0 execution

**Recommendation**: Option 1 (in-place updates) with revision history entry maintains plan coherence and ensures improvements are not overlooked during implementation.

## 11. Next Steps

### For Plan Revision

1. Update Phase 0 template creation task with official frontmatter fields
2. Update Phase 1 to clarify registry approach (filesystem vs metadata file)
3. Update Phase 4 to add description engineering guidance
4. Update all Phase 4 skill creation tasks with activation triggers
5. Add activation testing to Phase 6 validation suite

### For Implementation

1. Review official Skills examples (commit-message-helper, code-reviewer, pdf-processing)
2. Test activation behavior with sample Skills before Phase 0
3. Validate that proposed skills directory structure works with Claude's discovery mechanism
4. Test whether command behavioral prompts need Skills references (Phase 5)

### For Standards Compliance

1. Verify all plan updates use timeless writing (no "recently added", "new feature" markers)
2. Maintain present-tense artifact descriptions ("X (extended with...)")
3. Add revision history entry documenting research-based improvements

## Conclusion

The official Claude Code Skills documentation reveals that Skills are fundamentally model-invoked capabilities that activate autonomously based on description matching. This architectural pattern requires adjustments to the skills integration plan, particularly in:

1. **Phase 0**: Frontmatter template must match official spec
2. **Phase 1**: Registry approach needs clarification (filesystem vs metadata)
3. **Phase 4**: Skills need description engineering with activation triggers
4. **All phases**: Testing must verify autonomous activation

The plan's existing emphasis on guidance over enforcement (Phase 4, line 335-336) aligns well with the model-invoked nature of Skills. Strengthening this distinction and adding activation trigger guidance will ensure successful Skills integration that leverages Claude's contextual intelligence.

**Overall Assessment**: Plan is 70-80% aligned with official docs. Key gaps are in frontmatter specification, description engineering, and activation testing. All gaps are addressable through targeted updates to existing phases without requiring structural changes to the 6-phase approach.
