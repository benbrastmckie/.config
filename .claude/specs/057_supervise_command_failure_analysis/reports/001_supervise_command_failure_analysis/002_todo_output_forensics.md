# TODO.md Output Forensics

## Metadata
- **Date**: 2025-10-27
- **Agent**: research-specialist
- **Topic**: todo_output_forensics
- **Report Type**: forensic analysis
- **Parent Report**: [OVERVIEW.md](./OVERVIEW.md)

## Executive Summary

The TODO.md file reveals that /coordinate command never executed as an orchestrator command. Instead, the assistant treated the user's request as a normal conversation, created a TODO list, and performed direct analysis using Bash/Read tools rather than delegating to research subagents via the Task tool.

## Findings

### Finding 1: /coordinate Command Never Executed as Orchestrator

**Evidence from TODO.md (Lines 1-10)**:

The TODO.md file shows a user request on line 1:
```
> /supervise is running… I just ran /coordinate and got the output in /home/benjamin/.config/.claude/TODO.md instead of running
 research subagents as desired.
```

Lines 5-7 show the assistant's response pattern:
```
● I'll analyze the /coordinate command to identify why it's not executing research subagents correctly, comparing it
  against the working /supervise command. Let me start by examining both commands and the TODO.md file you mentioned.
```

**Critical Observation**: The assistant is treating this as a **normal user conversation**, not executing the /coordinate command as an orchestrator. The response pattern shows:
- Personal pronoun usage ("I'll analyze")
- Direct tool invocation from main assistant (not subagents)
- Explanatory narrative style (not orchestrator execution pattern)

### Finding 2: No Subagent Delegation via Task Tool

**Evidence from TODO.md (Lines 9-30)**:

The assistant performed direct tool invocations:
- Line 9: `Read(.claude/TODO.md)`
- Line 12: `Read(.claude/commands/coordinate.md)`
- Line 15: `Read(.claude/commands/supervise.md)`
- Line 20: `Read(.claude/agents/research-specialist.md)`
- Line 25: `Bash(mkdir -p "/home/benjamin/.config/.claude/specs/494_coordinate_command_failure_analysis/reports")`
- Line 28: `Write(.claude/specs/494_coordinate_command_failure_analysis/reports/001_coordinate_vs_supervise_analysis.md)`

**Critical Finding**: NO Task tool invocations found in entire TODO.md file.

**Grep Analysis** confirmed:
- 0 matches for "Task {" pattern
- 0 matches for "subagent_type:"
- 0 matches for "research-specialist" invocation (line 18 only mentions reading the behavioral file)
- 0 matches for "PROGRESS:" markers (which subagents emit)
- 0 matches for "REPORT_CREATED:" confirmations

**Conclusion**: The /coordinate command never delegated work to research subagents. All work was performed directly by the main assistant.

### Finding 3: TodoWrite Tool Usage (Orchestrator Commands Don't Use This)

**Evidence from TODO.md (Line 62)**:

Line 62 contains analysis text stating:
```
4. TodoWrite usage (orchestrator commands don't create workflow todos)
```

This is metadata from the report created by the assistant, but the fact that it's mentioning TodoWrite suggests the assistant may have used this tool during the /coordinate execution (or is analyzing its absence).

**Comparison with Working /supervise (Spec 475)**:

The successful /supervise execution in spec 475 shows:
- **4 separate research subtopic reports** created by research-specialist agents
- Each report has REPORT_CREATED confirmation
- Overview report aggregates findings
- No TodoWrite usage (orchestrators track via checkpoints, not todos)

**Current /coordinate execution shows**:
- 1 report created by main assistant (not subagent)
- No REPORT_CREATED pattern
- Direct Write tool usage instead of subagent delegation
- Possible TodoWrite usage (analysis suggests this occurred)

### Finding 4: Meta-Level Failure Pattern

**Evidence from TODO.md (Lines 41-50)**:

The assistant's analysis text reveals it recognized the problem:
```
● I've completed a comprehensive analysis report comparing /coordinate with the working /supervise command. Here are the
  key findings:

  Critical Discovery: Meta-Level Failure

  The /coordinate command is not executing at all. Instead of the orchestrator command running, the assistant is treating
  your invocation as a normal user request and trying to help by:
  - Creating todo lists
  - Using Bash/Grep directly
  - Never invoking research subagents via the Task tool
```

**Critical Observation**: The assistant performing the analysis correctly identified that /coordinate didn't execute, but this analysis itself demonstrates the problem—the assistant is explaining what should have happened rather than the /coordinate command orchestrating subagents.

### Finding 5: Report Created, But Wrong Creation Pattern

**Evidence from TODO.md (Lines 25-30)**:

```
● Bash(mkdir -p "/home/benjamin/.config/.claude/specs/494_coordinate_command_failure_analysis/reports")
  ⎿  (No content)

● Write(.claude/specs/494_coordinate_command_failure_analysis/reports/001_coordinate_vs_supervise_analysis.md)
  ⎿  Wrote 464 lines to
     .claude/specs/494_coordinate_command_failure_analysis/reports/001_coordinate_vs_supervise_analysis.md
```

**Analysis**:
- Main assistant created the directory structure manually using Bash
- Main assistant wrote the report file directly using Write tool
- No parent directory lazy creation via research-specialist agent
- No research-specialist behavioral file protocol followed
- Report created directly, not delegated to subagent

**Expected Pattern (from research-specialist.md behavioral file)**:
```bash
# Step 1.5: Ensure parent directory exists
source .claude/lib/unified-location-detection.sh
ensure_artifact_directory "$REPORT_PATH"

# Step 2: Create report file FIRST
Write(report_path, initial_structure)

# Step 3: Conduct research and update
# ... research activities ...

# Step 4: Return confirmation
REPORT_CREATED: /absolute/path/to/report.md
```

**Actual Pattern Observed**:
```bash
# Manual directory creation
Bash(mkdir -p "...")

# Direct write
Write(report_path, complete_report)

# Narrative explanation (not REPORT_CREATED confirmation)
"I've completed a comprehensive analysis report..."
```

### Finding 6: Spec Directory Structure Discrepancy

**Evidence from filesystem check**:

Directory `/home/benjamin/.config/.claude/specs/494_coordinate_command_failure_analysis/` exists with:
```
reports/
  001_coordinate_vs_supervise_analysis.md
```

**Missing artifacts** (expected from working /supervise pattern):
- No `plans/` subdirectory
- No `summaries/` subdirectory
- No `debug/` subdirectory
- Only one report file (should have multiple subtopic reports + overview)

**Comparison with working spec 475**:
```
specs/475_supervise_command_failure_investigation/
  reports/
    001_supervise_command_failure_investigation_research/
      001_command_invocation_and_argument_parsing.md
      002_todo_md_output_behavior_analysis.md
      003_subagent_execution_failure_root_cause.md
      004_recent_changes_and_environmental_factors.md
      OVERVIEW.md
```

**Conclusion**: The /coordinate execution created a **single report via main assistant** instead of **multiple subtopic reports via research subagents**.

### Finding 7: No Progress Markers Throughout Execution

**Evidence**: Grep analysis of TODO.md found 0 matches for:
- `PROGRESS:` markers
- `REPORT_CREATED:` confirmations
- `Research complete` messages
- `Starting research` messages

**Expected Pattern (from research-specialist.md behavioral file, lines 206-236)**:

Research subagents MUST emit progress markers:
```
PROGRESS: Creating report file at [path]
PROGRESS: Starting research on [topic]
PROGRESS: Searching codebase for [pattern]
PROGRESS: Found [N] files, analyzing implementations
PROGRESS: Updating report with findings
PROGRESS: Research complete, report verified
```

**Observed Pattern**: Complete absence of any progress markers.

**Conclusion**: No research-specialist agents were ever invoked during /coordinate execution.

## Recommendations

### Recommendation 1: Investigate SlashCommand Tool Failure

**Priority**: CRITICAL

**Action**: Determine why /coordinate invocation didn't trigger the SlashCommand tool execution.

**Investigation Steps**:
1. Check if /coordinate is properly registered in available commands list
2. Verify command file location and naming convention
3. Test with explicit SlashCommand tool invocation:
   ```
   SlashCommand("/coordinate <workflow>")
   ```
4. Review Claude Code logs for SlashCommand tool errors
5. Compare /coordinate registration with working /supervise command

**Expected Outcome**: Identify whether:
- Command file is missing/mislocated
- SlashCommand tool failed to recognize command
- Command file has syntax errors preventing execution
- Library dependencies are missing (e.g., dependency-analyzer.sh)

### Recommendation 2: Add Command Execution Verification

**Priority**: HIGH

**Action**: Add explicit verification that orchestrator commands are executing, not being interpreted as user requests.

**Implementation**:
Add to beginning of /coordinate command (after frontmatter):
```bash
# Execution verification marker
echo "COORDINATE_EXECUTING: Phase 0 Starting"
echo "Command invoked at: $(date)"
echo "Arguments: $@"

# If this marker doesn't appear in output, command never executed
```

**Benefit**: Provides immediate diagnostic signal if command doesn't execute. If user sees conversational response instead of "COORDINATE_EXECUTING", command failed to run.

### Recommendation 3: Compare Command Registration

**Priority**: HIGH

**Action**: Audit differences in how /supervise vs /coordinate are registered and invoked.

**Comparison Checklist**:
```bash
# Check both commands exist
ls -la .claude/commands/supervise.md
ls -la .claude/commands/coordinate.md

# Compare frontmatter
head -20 .claude/commands/supervise.md
head -20 .claude/commands/coordinate.md

# Check for syntax errors
bash -n .claude/commands/supervise.md
bash -n .claude/commands/coordinate.md

# Verify library dependencies
grep "source.*\.sh" .claude/commands/supervise.md
grep "source.*\.sh" .claude/commands/coordinate.md
```

**Analysis**: Identify structural differences that might prevent /coordinate execution.

### Recommendation 4: Test Minimal /coordinate Invocation

**Priority**: HIGH

**Action**: Create minimal test to isolate failure point.

**Test Procedure**:
1. Add debug output at very start of /coordinate (line 1 after frontmatter)
2. Invoke with simplest possible workflow: `/coordinate "test workflow"`
3. Check if debug output appears
4. If no debug output, command never executed (SlashCommand tool failure)
5. If debug output appears, failure is later in command execution

**Diagnostic Output**:
```bash
echo "═══════════════════════════════════════"
echo "DEBUG: /coordinate command starting"
echo "DEBUG: PWD=$PWD"
echo "DEBUG: Arguments count: $#"
echo "DEBUG: First argument: $1"
echo "═══════════════════════════════════════"
```

### Recommendation 5: Review Recent /coordinate Changes

**Priority**: MEDIUM

**Action**: Check git history for recent modifications to /coordinate that might have broken execution.

**Git Commands**:
```bash
# View recent changes to coordinate.md
git log -10 --oneline -- .claude/commands/coordinate.md

# Show last modification
git log -1 -p -- .claude/commands/coordinate.md

# Compare with working version (if exists)
git diff HEAD~5 -- .claude/commands/coordinate.md
```

**Look For**:
- Syntax errors introduced in recent commits
- Library sourcing changes
- Frontmatter modifications
- Missing function definitions (like display_completion_summary in /supervise bug)

### Recommendation 6: Create Integration Test for Command Execution

**Priority**: MEDIUM

**Action**: Add automated test to verify orchestrator commands execute (not interpreted as user requests).

**Test Implementation** (.claude/tests/test_command_execution.sh):
```bash
#!/bin/bash

test_command_execution_signal() {
  # Test that /coordinate produces execution marker
  output=$(/coordinate "test workflow" 2>&1)

  if echo "$output" | grep -q "COORDINATE_EXECUTING"; then
    echo "✓ PASS: Command executed as orchestrator"
    return 0
  else
    echo "✗ FAIL: Command interpreted as user request"
    echo "Output: $output"
    return 1
  fi
}

test_command_execution_signal
```

**Integration**: Add to test suite run by /test-all command.

### Recommendation 7: Document Expected vs Actual Behavior

**Priority**: LOW

**Action**: Create clear specification of expected /coordinate execution pattern for future debugging.

**Documentation** (.claude/docs/debugging/command-execution-patterns.md):

**Expected Pattern**:
1. User invokes: `/coordinate "research X"`
2. SlashCommand tool executes coordinate.md
3. Orchestrator starts Phase 0 (library sourcing, metadata calculation)
4. Orchestrator invokes 2-4 research-specialist subagents via Task tool
5. Subagents emit PROGRESS markers
6. Subagents return REPORT_CREATED confirmations
7. Orchestrator aggregates findings into OVERVIEW report
8. Workflow completes with summary

**Failure Pattern (Observed)**:
1. User invokes: `/coordinate "research X"`
2. SlashCommand tool FAILS to execute (reason unknown)
3. Main assistant interprets as user request
4. Assistant performs direct analysis (Bash/Read/Write)
5. Assistant creates single report via Write tool
6. No subagent delegation occurs
7. No PROGRESS markers emitted
8. Conversational response instead of orchestrator summary
