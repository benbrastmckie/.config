# Research Overview: /supervise Command Failure Analysis

## Metadata
- **Date**: 2025-10-27
- **Agent**: research-synthesizer
- **Topic Number**: 057

## Executive Summary

The /supervise command failure investigation reveals a **meta-level execution failure** rather than an architectural compliance problem. While the command itself demonstrates exemplary adherence to Standard 11 (100% compliance across all 9 agent invocations) and correctly implements the behavioral injection pattern, the actual execution never occurred. Instead, the assistant interpreted the user's invocation as a normal conversation request, performing direct analysis using Read/Write/Bash tools rather than executing the orchestrator command's predefined workflow phases. Root cause analysis points to a library sourcing failure or command file parsing error that prevents the orchestrator from starting, causing Claude to default to conversational mode.

## Cross-Report Findings

### The Paradox: Perfect Compliance, Zero Execution

A critical pattern emerges across all reports: **the /supervise command is architecturally perfect but operationally inactive**.

- **[Command Structure Analysis](./001_supervise_command_structure_analysis.md)** confirms 100% Standard 11 compliance (10/10 invocations with imperative instructions, behavioral file references, no code block wrappers)
- **[Architectural Pattern Compliance](./004_architectural_pattern_compliance.md)** validates zero anti-pattern violations and perfect role separation (orchestrator vs executor)
- **[TODO Output Forensics](./002_todo_output_forensics.md)** reveals zero Task tool invocations, zero progress markers, and zero agent delegations in actual execution
- **[Expected vs Actual Behavior](./003_expected_vs_actual_behavior.md)** documents the complete absence of orchestrator behavioral signatures

This paradox—perfect static analysis but zero runtime execution—indicates a **bootstrap failure**: the orchestrator command never initializes, so its compliant architecture never activates.

### Behavioral Signature Mismatch

All four reports identify the same **behavioral signature divergence**:

**Orchestrator Signature** (Expected from [Command Structure Analysis](./001_supervise_command_structure_analysis.md)):
- Library sourcing with fallback warnings
- Workflow scope detection with boxed display
- Phase 0 header: "Location and Path Pre-Calculation"
- Progress markers: `PROGRESS: [Phase N] - action`
- Task tool invocations with research-specialist behavioral injection
- Verification checkpoints with box drawing characters
- Minimal status messages (not explanations)

**Assistant Signature** (Observed from [TODO Output Forensics](./002_todo_output_forensics.md)):
- First-person commentary: "I'll analyze...", "I've completed..."
- Direct tool usage: Read, Write, Bash without delegation
- Interpretive analysis: "Critical Discovery:", "Root Cause Analysis"
- Zero progress markers, zero agent invocations, zero verification checkpoints
- Extensive explanatory text and proactive recommendations

The complete absence of orchestrator signatures in TODO.md demonstrates the command never started execution.

### Library Sourcing as Critical Failure Point

Multiple reports converge on **library sourcing failure** as the most likely root cause:

- **[Expected vs Actual Behavior](./003_expected_vs_actual_behavior.md)** (Hypothesis 1) identifies library sourcing failure as "MOST LIKELY" with evidence: no bash library sourcing output visible, no error messages about missing libraries, command should fail immediately if critical libraries missing
- **[Architectural Pattern Compliance](./004_architectural_pattern_compliance.md)** documents 7 critical libraries required in Phase 0: workflow-detection.sh, error-handling.sh, checkpoint-utils.sh, unified-logger.sh, unified-location-detection.sh, metadata-extraction.sh, context-pruning.sh
- **[Command Structure Analysis](./001_supervise_command_structure_analysis.md)** confirms Phase 0 implementation includes pre-calculation of ALL artifact paths, which depends on successfully sourced libraries

If library sourcing fails silently (e.g., incorrect SCRIPT_DIR calculation), the command exits before Phase 0 starts, causing Claude to treat the invocation as a normal user request.

### Historical Refactor Success Creates Current Mystery

The **[Architectural Pattern Compliance](./004_architectural_pattern_compliance.md)** report documents that /supervise was successfully refactored in spec 438 (completed 2025-10-24) to eliminate documentation-only YAML block anti-patterns, achieving:
- 617 line reduction (24% from 2,520 → 1,903 lines)
- Agent delegation rate improvement from 0% → 100%
- Full compliance with Standard 11
- Test results: 6/6 regression tests passing

This raises a critical question: **Why does a successfully refactored and tested command fail to execute?**

Possible explanations synthesized across reports:
1. **Environment Change**: Library files may have been moved, deleted, or had permissions changed after spec 438 testing
2. **BASH_SOURCE Issue**: The execution environment may not support BASH_SOURCE[0] resolution correctly (documented in [Expected vs Actual Behavior](./003_expected_vs_actual_behavior.md), Hypothesis 4)
3. **SlashCommand Tool Failure**: The SlashCommand tool may have failed to expand supervise.md content into the prompt (documented in [TODO Output Forensics](./002_todo_output_forensics.md), Recommendation 1)
4. **Post-Refactor Regression**: Changes after 2025-10-24 may have introduced syntax errors not caught by bash -n validation

## Detailed Findings by Topic

### 1. Command Structure Analysis

The /supervise command contains **10 agent invocations** across 6 workflow phases (Research, Planning, Implementation, Testing, Debug, Documentation) with **100% Standard 11 compliance**. All invocations use:
- Imperative instructions (`**EXECUTE NOW**: USE the Task tool...`)
- Direct behavioral file references (`.claude/agents/*.md`)
- Zero code block wrappers around Task invocations
- Explicit completion signal requirements
- Behavioral injection pattern (15-25 lines context injection, no duplication)

The command correctly implements the Orchestrator Role: pre-calculates artifact paths, creates topic directory structure, exports paths for subagent injection, uses Task tool (not SlashCommand) for all agent invocations.

**Key Observation**: Zero code block wrappers found around actual Task invocations (contrast with anti-pattern where 7 YAML blocks were code-fenced).

### 2. TODO Output Forensics

The TODO.md file reveals the assistant treated the user's /supervise request as a normal conversation rather than executing the orchestrator command. Evidence:
- **Zero Task tool invocations** (grep confirmed 0 matches for "Task {", "subagent_type:", "PROGRESS:", "REPORT_CREATED:")
- **Direct tool usage**: Read (4 times), Write (1 time), Bash (1 time) performed by main assistant
- **Wrong creation pattern**: Main assistant created directory structure manually and wrote report directly (not delegated to research-specialist agent)
- **Spec directory discrepancy**: Only 1 report created instead of multiple subtopic reports + overview

Comparison with working spec 475 (successful /supervise execution) shows the correct pattern produces 4 separate research subtopic reports created by research-specialist agents with REPORT_CREATED confirmations and overview report aggregating findings.

### 3. Expected vs Actual Behavior

Comprehensive comparison reveals the /supervise command is designed as a **pure orchestrator** with strict architectural constraints:
- **Tools Allowed**: Task (agent delegation), TodoWrite (phase progress), Bash (verification only), Read (metadata extraction only)
- **Tools Prohibited**: SlashCommand, Write/Edit (agents create files), Grep/Glob (agents search codebase)
- **Phase Execution**: Phase 0 (path pre-calculation) → Phase 1 (research) → Phase 2 (planning) → Phase 3 (implementation) → Phase 4 (testing) → Phase 5 (debug, conditional) → Phase 6 (documentation, conditional)

The actual execution showed zero orchestrator behavior:
- No library sourcing output
- No workflow scope detection
- No Phase 0 execution
- No progress markers
- No agent invocations
- No verification checkpoints

**Root Cause Analysis** identifies four hypotheses, with **Library Sourcing Failure** marked as "MOST LIKELY" based on evidence that command should fail immediately if critical libraries missing but no error messages appeared.

### 4. Architectural Pattern Compliance

Static analysis confirms the /supervise command is **FULLY COMPLIANT** with all architectural standards:
- ✅ Uses Task tool for all 9 agent invocations (100% delegation rate)
- ✅ Includes imperative "EXECUTE NOW" markers at all invocation points
- ✅ References agent behavioral files with context injection only
- ✅ Pre-calculates artifact paths in Phase 0 before any agent invocations
- ✅ Contains NO code-fenced Task examples that could cause priming effect
- ✅ Contains NO "Example agent invocation:" documentation-only patterns
- ✅ Uses bash ONLY for verification checkpoints (not execution)
- ✅ Implements proper role separation (orchestrator vs executor)

**Historical Context**: The command was refactored in spec 438 to eliminate anti-patterns, achieving 617 line reduction, 100% agent delegation rate, and full Standard 11 compliance. Current state verification confirms no pattern regression.

**Compliance Metrics**: 9/9 invocations (100%) comply with all 5 Standard 11 requirements. Zero anti-pattern violations detected across 8 compliance checks.

## Recommended Approach

### Immediate Diagnostics (Priority: CRITICAL)

Execute the following diagnostic steps in sequence to identify the root cause:

1. **Verify Library Files Exist and Are Accessible**
   ```bash
   ls -la /home/benjamin/.config/.claude/lib/{workflow-detection,error-handling,checkpoint-utils,unified-logger,unified-location-detection,metadata-extraction,context-pruning}.sh
   ```
   **Expected**: All 7 library files should exist with read permissions
   **If Missing**: Library sourcing failure confirmed (most likely root cause)

2. **Check Bash Syntax of supervise.md**
   ```bash
   bash -n /home/benjamin/.config/.claude/commands/supervise.md 2>&1 | head -20
   ```
   **Expected**: No syntax errors
   **If Errors**: Command file parsing error confirmed (prevents execution)

3. **Test SCRIPT_DIR Calculation Manually**
   ```bash
   cd /home/benjamin/.config/.claude/commands && \
   SCRIPT_DIR="$(cd "$(dirname "supervise.md")" && pwd)" && \
   echo "SCRIPT_DIR: $SCRIPT_DIR" && \
   ls -la "$SCRIPT_DIR/../lib/"
   ```
   **Expected**: SCRIPT_DIR resolves to /home/benjamin/.config/.claude/commands and lib/ directory is accessible
   **If Failed**: BASH_SOURCE calculation issue confirmed

4. **Add Early Debug Output**
   Insert at the very start of supervise.md (before library sourcing):
   ```bash
   echo "DEBUG: /supervise command starting execution"
   echo "DEBUG: BASH_SOURCE[0]=${BASH_SOURCE[0]}"
   echo "DEBUG: Current directory: $(pwd)"
   ```
   **Test Execution**: If debug output doesn't appear, command never executed (SlashCommand tool routing failure)

### Architectural Fixes (Priority: HIGH)

Based on diagnostic results, apply appropriate fixes:

**If Library Sourcing Failure**:
1. Add fallback for critical libraries (similar to workflow-detection.sh fallback pattern)
2. Add explicit error messages showing searched paths and actual directory state
3. Add function existence verification with diagnostic output if functions missing

**If Command File Parsing Error**:
1. Review recent changes to supervise.md since 2025-10-24 (spec 438 completion)
2. Check for unclosed quotes, unescaped backticks, or other syntax issues
3. Validate all bash code blocks with shellcheck

**If BASH_SOURCE Issue**:
1. Replace BASH_SOURCE[0] calculation with alternative method
2. Use absolute path to .claude/commands directory
3. Test in actual execution environment (not just manual bash testing)

**If SlashCommand Tool Routing Failure**:
1. Verify /supervise is registered in command index
2. Check command file expansion mechanism
3. Test with explicit SlashCommand tool invocation

### Long-Term Improvements (Priority: MEDIUM)

1. **Add Startup Marker**: Orchestrator MUST echo startup signal before any agent invocations
   ```bash
   echo "ORCHESTRATOR_ACTIVE: /supervise v1.0"
   ```

2. **Validate Execution Environment**: Add Phase 0 check for orchestrator mode
   ```bash
   if [ -z "$ORCHESTRATOR_MODE" ]; then
     echo "ERROR: /supervise must run in orchestrator mode"
     exit 1
   fi
   ```

3. **Add Comprehensive Diagnostic Mode**: Create `/supervise --diagnose` flag that outputs:
   - Library file locations and sizes
   - Function availability after sourcing
   - SCRIPT_DIR calculation result
   - Workflow scope detection test

4. **Create Integration Test**: Add automated test to verify orchestrator commands execute (not interpreted as user requests)
   ```bash
   # Test implementation in .claude/tests/test_command_execution.sh
   test_command_execution_signal() {
     output=$(/supervise "test workflow" 2>&1)
     if echo "$output" | grep -q "ORCHESTRATOR_ACTIVE"; then
       echo "✓ PASS: Command executed as orchestrator"
     else
       echo "✗ FAIL: Command interpreted as user request"
     fi
   }
   ```

## Constraints and Trade-offs

### Static vs Runtime Analysis Gap

**Constraint**: Static analysis (reading command file structure) cannot detect runtime execution failures (library sourcing, environment issues).

**Trade-off**: Perfect architectural compliance (verified) does not guarantee successful execution (failed). This research identified the command structure is correct but the execution environment may be broken.

**Mitigation**: Immediate diagnostics focus on runtime environment validation rather than architectural refactoring.

### Historical Success vs Current Failure Mystery

**Constraint**: Spec 438 (2025-10-24) documented successful refactor with 6/6 regression tests passing, yet current execution fails completely.

**Trade-off**: Something changed between 2025-10-24 and 2025-10-27 (3 days), but without execution logs or error messages, the exact change is unknown.

**Mitigation**: Diagnostic step 1 (verify library files exist) will confirm if environment changed post-refactor.

### Bootstrap Failure Prevents Normal Debugging

**Constraint**: Because the orchestrator command never starts, normal debugging techniques (progress markers, verification checkpoints, agent output inspection) cannot be used.

**Trade-off**: Must rely on environmental diagnostics (bash syntax check, library file verification) rather than workflow-level debugging.

**Mitigation**: Early debug output insertion (before library sourcing) provides earliest possible failure detection point.

### Meta-Level Failure Detection Difficulty

**Constraint**: When Claude treats a command invocation as a normal conversation, users may not immediately recognize the meta-level failure (they see helpful analysis rather than orchestrator execution).

**Trade-off**: Silent failure mode provides no error messages or stack traces—just wrong behavior pattern.

**Mitigation**: Add startup marker (`ORCHESTRATOR_ACTIVE:`) that MUST appear if command executes correctly, providing clear signal to users.

## Implementation Priority

## Conclusion

The /supervise command failure analysis reveals a **bootstrap failure** where an architecturally perfect command (100% Standard 11 compliance, zero anti-pattern violations) fails to execute due to likely **library sourcing failure**. The command was successfully refactored in spec 438 (2025-10-24) but something changed in the environment between then and now (2025-10-27) that prevents orchestrator initialization.

**Critical Finding**: The command structure is correct, but the execution environment may be broken. This is confirmed by the paradox of perfect static analysis (all 4 reports validate architectural compliance) but zero runtime execution (TODO.md shows assistant conversational mode instead of orchestrator mode).

**Root Cause (Most Likely)**: Library sourcing failure prevents Phase 0 from starting, causing Claude to default to conversational mode when /supervise invocation occurs. If critical libraries (error-handling.sh, checkpoint-utils.sh, unified-logger.sh, unified-location-detection.sh, metadata-extraction.sh, context-pruning.sh) are missing, moved, or have incorrect permissions, the command exits silently before any orchestrator behavioral signatures can appear.

**Immediate Action Required**: Execute diagnostic steps 1-3 to confirm library file accessibility, bash syntax validity, and SCRIPT_DIR calculation correctness. Based on results, apply targeted architectural fix from recommended approach.

**Long-Term Prevention**: Add startup marker (`ORCHESTRATOR_ACTIVE:`) and diagnostic mode (`--diagnose`) to all orchestration commands to enable faster meta-level failure detection and troubleshooting.

**OVERVIEW_SUMMARY**:
The /supervise command failure stems from a bootstrap failure, not architectural problems. The command shows perfect Standard 11 compliance (100% across 9 agent invocations) but never executes. TODO.md forensics reveal the assistant treated the invocation as a conversation, using direct tools instead of Task delegation. Root cause analysis across four reports identifies library sourcing failure as most likely: if critical libraries are missing/inaccessible, the command exits before Phase 0, causing Claude to default to conversational mode. Immediate diagnostics needed to verify library files and bash syntax.

**METADATA**:
- Reports Synthesized: 4
- Cross-Report Patterns: 3 major patterns (Perfect Compliance/Zero Execution Paradox, Behavioral Signature Mismatch, Library Sourcing as Critical Failure Point)
- Recommended Approach: Immediate diagnostics (verify library files, bash syntax, SCRIPT_DIR calculation), then apply targeted fix based on root cause confirmation
- Critical Constraints: Static analysis cannot detect runtime failures; bootstrap failure prevents normal debugging; meta-level failure provides no error messages
