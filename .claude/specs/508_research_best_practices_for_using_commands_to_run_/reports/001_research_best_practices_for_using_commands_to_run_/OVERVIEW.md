## Executive Summary

The codebase implements comprehensive best practices for context window preservation in multi-agent orchestration commands, achieving 92-97% context reduction while coordinating 10-30 specialized agents across hierarchical supervision levels. Key techniques include metadata extraction (5,000→250 tokens per artifact), behavioral injection pattern (100% file creation reliability), wave-based parallel execution (40-60% time savings), aggressive context pruning (96% per phase), and unified library integration (85% token reduction in Phase 0). The standards infrastructure provides 13 architectural standards with imperative enforcement patterns, validated through three historical case studies showing delegation rates improving from 0% to >90%. All orchestration commands maintain <30% context usage throughout 7-phase workflows while supporting recursive supervision up to 3 levels deep.

## Cross-Report Findings

### Unified Context Preservation Strategy

All four reports converge on a **five-layer context preservation strategy** that enables orchestration commands to coordinate 10+ agents while maintaining <30% context usage:

**Layer 1: Metadata Extraction** (Reports 1, 2, 4)
- Extract title + 50-word summary + key findings + recommendations + file paths
- Per-artifact reduction: 5,000 tokens → 250 tokens (95%)
- Implemented in `.claude/lib/metadata-extraction.sh` with three core functions
- Applied after every agent invocation and phase completion

**Layer 2: Forward Message Pattern** (Reports 1, 4)
- Pass subagent metadata directly without re-summarization or paraphrasing
- Overhead reduction: 800 tokens → 40 tokens for 4 agents (95%)
- Eliminates information loss and interpretation errors
- Critical for multi-agent coordination at scale

**Layer 3: Behavioral Injection** (Reports 2, 3)
- Commands orchestrate via Task tool with behavioral file injection, not SlashCommand chaining
- Achieves 100% file creation reliability through mandatory verification checkpoints
- Eliminates exponential context growth from command-to-command invocations
- Validated through three historical case studies (Specs 438, 495, 057)

**Layer 4: Aggressive Context Pruning** (Reports 1, 4)
- Prune full content after each phase, retain only metadata (200-300 tokens)
- Per-phase reduction: 5,000 tokens → 200 tokens (96%)
- Three pruning policies: aggressive (orchestration), moderate (implementation), minimal (single-agent)
- Implemented in `.claude/lib/context-pruning.sh`

**Layer 5: Checkpoint-Based External State** (Reports 1, 4)
- Store full workflow state in `.claude/data/checkpoints/workflow_id.json`
- On-demand loading: 10,000 tokens → 500 tokens (95% reduction)
- Enables workflow resume without context accumulation
- Supports unlimited state storage with minimal context consumption

**Quantified Impact Across Workflows**:
- 7-phase orchestrator without protection: 40,000 tokens (160% overflow)
- 7-phase orchestrator with protection: 7,000 tokens (28% context usage)
- Hierarchical supervision (3 levels): 60,000 → 4,000 tokens (93% reduction)
- Agent coordination scalability: 2-3 agents → 10+ agents per supervisor

### Architectural Pattern Consistency

Reports 2 and 3 identify **behavioral injection** as the foundational architectural pattern, with consistent implementation across all 13 orchestration commands:

**Core Pattern Elements** (Standard 11):
1. **Imperative directive**: `**EXECUTE NOW**: USE the Task tool NOW`
2. **Behavioral file reference**: `.claude/agents/research-specialist.md` (not inline duplication)
3. **No code block wrappers**: Prevents documentation interpretation priming effect
4. **Pre-calculated absolute paths**: Parent command calculates all paths before agent invocations
5. **Explicit completion signal**: `REPORT_CREATED: [EXACT_ABSOLUTE_PATH]`

**Historical Validation** (Report 2):
- **Spec 438** (2025-10-24): /supervise - 7 YAML blocks caused 0% delegation, fixed to >90%
- **Spec 495** (2025-10-27): /coordinate and /research - 12 invocations (0% delegation) fixed through removing code fences
- **Spec 057** (2025-10-27): /supervise robustness - removed 32 lines of bootstrap fallbacks

**Enforcement Mechanisms** (Report 3):
- **Standard 12**: Structural vs behavioral content separation (single source of truth)
- **Validation script**: `.claude/lib/validate-agent-invocation-pattern.sh`
- **Testing**: `.claude/tests/test_orchestration_commands.sh` (comprehensive delegation testing)
- **Quality rubric**: Standard 0.5 with 95+/100 target across 10 enforcement categories

**Performance Metrics** (Report 2):
- File creation rate: 60-80% → 100% (explicit path injection)
- Context usage: 80-100% → <30% (metadata-only passing)
- Parallelization: Impossible → 40-60% time savings (independent agents)

### Phase 0 Optimization Breakthrough

Reports 4 and 2 document a **25x speedup** achieved by replacing agent-based path calculation with unified library integration:

**Previous Approach** (location-specialist agent):
- Token usage: 75,600 tokens
- Execution time: 25.2 seconds
- Created 400-500 empty subdirectories

**Current Approach** (unified-location-detection.sh):
- Token usage: <11,000 tokens (85% reduction)
- Execution time: <1 second (25x speedup)
- Lazy directory creation (80% reduction in mkdir calls)
- Functions: detect_project_root(), detect_specs_directory(), get_next_topic_number(), create_topic_structure()

**Integration Pattern** (Report 4):
```bash
source .claude/lib/unified-location-detection.sh
TOPIC_DIR=$(get_or_create_topic_dir "$WORKFLOW_DESCRIPTION" "specs")
REPORT_PATH=$(create_topic_artifact "$TOPIC_DIR" "reports" "auth_patterns" "")
```

**Cascading Benefits**:
- Near-instantaneous Phase 0 completion (<1s vs ~25s)
- Zero context accumulation before research phase
- Eliminates directory pollution from failed workflows
- Consistent path structure across all orchestration commands

This pattern is now implemented in `/orchestrate`, `/coordinate`, `/research`, and recommended for all new orchestration commands.

### Hierarchical Supervision Scalability

Reports 1, 2, and 4 converge on **recursive supervision** as the enabling mechanism for coordinating 10-30 agents across 3 hierarchy levels:

**Architecture Levels**:
```
Level 0: Primary Orchestrator (command-level, e.g., /orchestrate)
    ↓
Level 1: Domain Supervisors (research, implementation, testing)
    ↓
Level 2: Specialized Subagents (auth research, API research, security research)
    ↓
Level 3: Task Executors (focused single-task, rarely used)
```

**Scalability Metrics** (Report 2):
- Flat coordination: 2-4 agents maximum
- 2-level hierarchy: 8-16 agents (4 sub-supervisors × 4 workers)
- 3-level hierarchy: 16-64 agents (4 × 4 × 4)
- Depth limit: Maximum 3 levels (prevents complexity explosion)

**Real-World Performance** (Plan 080, 10-agent research phase):
- Without sub-supervisors: 10 reports × 500 tokens = 5,000 tokens (25% context)
- With sub-supervisors: 3 domains × 150 tokens = 450 tokens (2.25% context)
- Context reduction: 91%
- Scalability: Enables 40+ agents before hitting 30% threshold (vs 12 without)

**Supervision Tracking Utilities** (Report 2):
- `track_supervision_depth()`: Prevent infinite recursion (MAX_SUPERVISION_DEPTH=3)
- `generate_supervision_tree()`: Visualize hierarchical structure for debugging
- Agent registry: Track performance metrics (97.9% success rate for research-specialist)

**Industry Alignment** (Report 2):
- AgentOrchestra Framework (arXiv:2506.12508): Central planning with hierarchical execution
- Taxonomy of Hierarchical MAS (arXiv:2508.12683): Metadata-based communication for scalability
- Novel contribution: Behavioral injection pattern unique to this codebase

### Standards Infrastructure Maturity

Report 3 documents a comprehensive standards infrastructure with **13 architectural standards** and extensive enforcement mechanisms:

**Standard Categories**:
- **Standards 0-0.5**: Execution enforcement (imperative language, subagent prompt enforcement, quality rubric 95+/100)
- **Standards 1-3**: Content requirements (inline execution, reference pattern, information density)
- **Standards 4-5**: Template completeness and structural annotations
- **Standards 11**: Imperative agent invocation pattern (preventing 0% delegation anti-pattern)
- **Standards 12**: Structural vs behavioral content separation (single source of truth)

**Documentation Hierarchy** (2,032 lines):

### Wave-Based Parallel Execution Innovation

Reports 1 and 4 document **wave-based parallel execution** achieving 40-60% time savings through dependency analysis:

**Dependency Analysis Process** (Report 4):
1. Parse implementation plan for phase dependencies
2. Extract `dependencies: [N, M]` from each phase
3. Build directed acyclic graph (DAG)
4. Group phases using Kahn's algorithm:
   - Wave 1: All phases with no dependencies
   - Wave 2: Phases depending only on Wave 1
   - Wave N: Phases depending only on previous waves

**Example Performance**:
```
Plan with 8 phases → 4 waves
  Wave 1: [Phase 1, Phase 2]          ← 2 phases in parallel
  Wave 2: [Phase 3, Phase 4, Phase 5] ← 3 phases in parallel
  Wave 3: [Phase 6, Phase 7]          ← 2 phases in parallel
  Wave 4: [Phase 8]                   ← 1 phase

Sequential: 8T
Wave-based: 4T
Savings: 50%
```

**Real-World Metrics** (Report 4):
- 4-agent research: 75% savings (40 min → 10 min)
- 5-phase implementation: 25% savings (16h → 12h)
- /orchestrate (7 phases): 40% savings (8h → 4.8h)
- Complex workflow (15 phases, 6 waves): 60% savings (30h → 12h)

**Implementation Libraries**:
- `.claude/lib/dependency-analyzer.sh`: Parse dependencies, build DAG, calculate waves
- `.claude/commands/coordinate.md`: Wave-based execution implementation (lines 187-244)
- Checkpoint-based wave recovery for resume capability

**Synergy with Metadata Extraction**:
- Parallel agents return metadata (250 tokens each) not full content (5,000 tokens)
- Context reduction enables 10+ parallel agents vs 2-3 sequential
- Combined benefit: 40-60% time savings + 95% context reduction

### Fail-Fast Philosophy vs Bootstrap Fallbacks

Reports 3 and 4 identify a critical architectural distinction between **fail-fast error handling** and **verification checkpoints**:

**Fail-Fast for Configuration Errors** (Spec 057):
- Bootstrap library loading: Exit immediately if libraries not found
- Function verification: Exit immediately if required functions missing
- Configuration validation: No silent degradation or fallback assumptions
- Benefits: 100% bootstrap reliability, easier debugging, predictable behavior

**5-Component Error Message Standard** (Report 4):
1. **What failed**: Specific operation that failed
2. **Expected state**: What should have happened
3. **Diagnostic commands**: Exact commands to investigate
4. **Context**: Why this operation is required
5. **Action**: Steps to resolve the issue

**Verification Checkpoints for Transient Failures** (Preserved):
- File creation verification: Detect Write tool failures
- Three-layer defense: Agent prompt enforcement → behavioral file reinforcement → command-level verification
- Single retry allowed for transient failures
- Benefits: 100% file creation reliability, prevents cascading phase failures

**Critical Distinction** (Report 4):
- **Bootstrap Fallbacks (REMOVED)**: Hide configuration errors that MUST be fixed
- **File Creation Verification Fallbacks (PRESERVED)**: Detect transient Write tool failures

**Spec 057 Case Study** (Report 3):
- Removed 32 lines of bootstrap fallbacks
- Enhanced 7 library error messages with 5-component diagnostics
- Result: 100% bootstrap reliability through fail-fast

### Workflow Scope Detection for Conditional Execution

Report 4 documents **workflow scope detection** for skipping inappropriate phases based on workflow type:

**Scope Types** (workflow-detection.sh):
1. **research-only**: Phases 0-1 only (no plan, no summary)
2. **research-and-plan**: Phases 0-2 only (MOST COMMON)
3. **full-implementation**: Phases 0-4, 6 (Phase 5 conditional on test failures)
4. **debug-only**: Phases 0, 1, 5 only (no new plan or summary)

**Detection Mechanism**:
- Keyword analysis from workflow description
- Examples: "research [topic]" → research-only, "implement [feature]" → full-implementation
- should_run_phase() function for phase-level checks

**Benefits**:
- Appropriate phase execution (no unnecessary planning for research-only)
- Clear user feedback explaining why phases skipped
- Performance optimization (skip phases, not execute-then-discard)
- Reduces cognitive load on orchestrator

**Integration**:
- All three orchestration commands (/orchestrate, /coordinate, /supervise) implement scope detection
- Recommended for all new multi-phase commands

### Context Budget Management Across Workflow Phases

Reports 1 and 4 provide detailed **context budget allocation** across 7-phase orchestration workflows:

**Layered Context Architecture**:

**Layer 1 (Permanent)**: 500-1,000 tokens (4%)
- User request, workflow type, current phase, critical errors
- Retained: Entire workflow duration

**Layer 2 (Phase-Scoped)**: 2,000-4,000 tokens (12%)
- Current phase instructions, agent invocations, verification checkpoints
- Retained: During phase only
- Pruned: After phase completion

**Layer 3 (Metadata)**: 200-300 tokens per phase (6% for 5 completed phases = 1,500 tokens)
- Artifact paths, phase summaries, key findings
- Retained: Between phases for decision-making
- Pruned: Apply pruning policy based on workflow scope

**Layer 4 (Transient)**: 0 tokens after pruning
- Full agent responses, detailed logs, intermediate calculations
- Pruned: Immediately after metadata extraction

**Context Budget Example** (6 phases):
- Layer 1: 1,000 tokens (4%)
- Layer 2: 3,000 tokens (12%) - current phase only
- Layer 3: 1,500 tokens (6%) - 5 completed phases × 300 tokens
- Layer 4: 0 tokens (pruned)
- **Total: 5,500 tokens (22% context usage)**

**Without Layering**: 40,000+ tokens (160% overflow) - cannot complete workflow

**Pruning Policies** (context-pruning.sh):
- **Aggressive** (orchestration): <20% target, 90-95% reduction
- **Moderate** (implementation): 20-30% target, 70-85% reduction
- **Minimal** (single-agent): 30-50% target, 40-60% reduction

## Detailed Findings by Topic

### Context Window Preservation Techniques

**Summary**: This report analyzes five core context preservation techniques achieving 92-97% token reduction: metadata extraction (5,000→250 tokens per artifact), forward message pattern (95% overhead reduction), aggressive context pruning (80-90% per phase), layered context architecture (86% total reduction), and checkpoint-based external storage (95% state reduction). Real-world implementations demonstrate <30% context usage across 7-phase workflows that would otherwise consume 160%. Claude Sonnet 4.5's 200,000-token window enables 10+ parallel agents versus 2-3 without these protections.

**Key Recommendations**:
1. **Priority 1 (Critical)**: Implement metadata-only passing (95% context reduction per subagent)
2. **Priority 2 (Critical)**: Apply forward message pattern (95% reduction in forwarding overhead)
3. **Priority 3 (High)**: Implement aggressive context pruning (96% reduction per phase)
4. **Priority 4 (High)**: Use layered context architecture (86% reduction across full workflow)
5. **Priority 5 (Medium)**: Checkpoint long-running workflows (95% reduction in state restoration)

### Hierarchical Agent Delegation Patterns

**Summary**: This report documents hierarchical agent delegation patterns enabling commands to coordinate 10-30 specialized agents across 3 supervision levels through behavioral injection, metadata-only communication, and recursive supervision. The codebase implements comprehensive patterns achieving 99% context reduction, 60-80% time savings through parallel execution, and 100% file creation reliability through mandatory verification checkpoints. Key mechanisms include pre-calculated topic-based artifact paths, Task tool invocations with behavioral file injection, and aggressive context pruning after each coordination phase. Real-world performance from Plan 080 shows 91% context reduction for 10-agent research phase.

**Key Recommendations**:
1. Always use behavioral injection pattern for multi-agent commands (100% file creation reliability)
2. Apply aggressive context pruning after each phase (maintains <30% usage)
3. Use sub-supervisors for workflows with 5+ agents (91% context reduction for 10 agents)
4. Implement mandatory verification checkpoints (100% file creation reliability)
5. Track agent performance in registry (data-driven agent selection)
6. Follow topic-based artifact organization (all artifacts in one numbered directory)
7. Prevent anti-patterns through validation (>90% delegation rate target)
8. Align with industry best practices (3-level depth limit, metadata-based communication)

**[Full Report](./002_hierarchical_agent_delegation_patterns.md)**

### Current Standards Documentation Review

**Summary**: The .claude/ documentation infrastructure provides comprehensive standards for command development with 13 architectural standards, extensive guides on behavioral injection, and metadata-based patterns. The CLAUDE.md file uses 11 tagged sections for discoverability, supporting 21 slash commands across 4 command types. Key findings show mature orchestration patterns, strong emphasis on imperative language, and 95% context reduction through metadata extraction. The standards document spans 2,032 lines with detailed enforcement mechanisms, quality assurance checklists, and historical case study validation.

**Key Recommendations**:
1. Simplify standard numbering and reduce fragmentation (renumber 0, 0.5, 1-5, 11-12 sequentially)
2. Create quick reference card for standard compliance (1-page developer reference)
3. Consolidate path calculation documentation (single authoritative source)
4. Add standards compliance dashboard (programmatic compliance tracking)
5. Enhance standards discovery mechanism (auto-generate [Used by:] tags)
6. Streamline agent behavioral file enforcement (automated scoring script)

### Orchestrator Workflow Optimization

**Summary**: Analysis of orchestrator workflow optimization reveals systematic performance improvements through unified library integration (85% token reduction, 25x speedup in Phase 0), wave-based parallel execution (40-60% time savings), metadata-only passing (95-99% context reduction), and fail-fast error handling with 5-component diagnostics. The research examined three orchestration commands totaling ~10,000 lines and identified patterns achieving 100% file creation reliability through verification checkpoints, <30% context usage across 7-phase workflows, and coordination of 10+ agents through recursive supervision. Key libraries include unified-location-detection.sh, workflow-detection.sh, metadata-extraction.sh, context-pruning.sh, and dependency-analyzer.sh.

**Key Recommendations**:
1. Adopt unified library integration for Phase 0 across all orchestrators (85% token reduction, 25x speedup)
2. Implement wave-based parallel execution for all implementation commands (40-60% time savings)
3. Enforce metadata-only passing between all agents and phases (95-99% context reduction)
4. Implement workflow scope detection for all multi-phase commands (skip inappropriate phases)
5. Adopt fail-fast error handling with 5-component diagnostics (100% bootstrap reliability)
6. Implement mandatory verification checkpoints for all file creation (100% reliability)

## Recommended Approach

### Synthesized Best Practice Framework

Based on the convergence across all four research reports, the following **unified framework** should be applied to all orchestration commands (research, planning, implementing, testing, debugging, documenting):

#### Phase 0: Path Pre-Calculation (MANDATORY)

**Implementation**:
```bash
# Source unified library
source .claude/lib/unified-location-detection.sh

# Calculate all artifact paths before agent invocations
TOPIC_DIR=$(get_or_create_topic_dir "$WORKFLOW_DESCRIPTION" "specs")
REPORT_PATHS=()
for i in $(seq 1 $RESEARCH_COMPLEXITY); do
  REPORT_PATH=$(create_topic_artifact "$TOPIC_DIR" "reports" "$SUBTOPIC_$i" "")
  REPORT_PATHS+=("$REPORT_PATH")
done
PLAN_PATH=$(create_topic_artifact "$TOPIC_DIR" "plans" "implementation" "")

echo "✓ Phase 0 complete: All paths calculated (<1s, <11k tokens)"
```

**Performance**:
- 85% token reduction (75,600 → 11,000 tokens)
- 25x speedup (25.2s → <1s)
- Zero empty directories (lazy creation)

#### Orchestration Pattern: Behavioral Injection (MANDATORY)

**Implementation Template**:
```markdown
**EXECUTE NOW**: USE the Task tool NOW with these parameters:

- subagent_type: "general-purpose"
- description: "Research [topic] with mandatory artifact creation"
- prompt: |
    Read and follow ALL behavioral guidelines from:
    /home/benjamin/.config/.claude/agents/research-specialist.md

    **Workflow-Specific Context**:
    - Research Topic: [display-friendly topic name]
    - Report Path: [absolute path from Phase 0]
    - Project Standards: /home/benjamin/.config/CLAUDE.md

    Execute research following all guidelines in behavioral file.
    Return: REPORT_CREATED: [EXACT_ABSOLUTE_PATH]
            REPORT_SUMMARY: [50-word summary]
            METADATA: [key findings, recommendations]
```

**Critical Requirements** (Standard 11):
1. Imperative directive (`**EXECUTE NOW**`)
2. Behavioral file reference (not inline duplication)
3. No code block wrappers (prevents documentation interpretation)
4. Pre-calculated absolute paths (from Phase 0)
5. Explicit completion signal (`REPORT_CREATED:`)

**Anti-Patterns to Avoid**:
- Documentation-only YAML blocks (causes 0% delegation rate)
- Code-fenced Task examples (priming effect)
- Command chaining via SlashCommand tool (exponential context growth)
- Calculation in agent context (bash escaping issues)

#### Context Reduction: Five-Layer Strategy (MANDATORY)

**Layer 1: Metadata Extraction**
```bash
# After agent invocation
METADATA=$(extract_report_metadata "$REPORT_PATH")
# Result: 5,000 tokens → 250 tokens (95% reduction)
```

**Layer 2: Forward Message Pattern**
```markdown
# Pass metadata directly to next phase
FORWARDING RESEARCH RESULTS:
{metadata from agent 1}
{metadata from agent 2}
Proceeding to planning phase.
# NO re-summarization, NO paraphrasing
```

**Layer 3: Aggressive Context Pruning**
```bash
# After phase completion
prune_phase_metadata "research"
# Result: 5,000 tokens → 200 tokens (96% reduction)
```

**Layer 4: Layered Context Architecture**
- Permanent (500-1,000 tokens): User request, workflow type
- Phase-scoped (2,000-4,000 tokens): Current phase only
- Metadata (200-300 tokens/phase): Between phases
- Transient (0 tokens): Pruned immediately

**Layer 5: Checkpoint-Based External State**
```bash
# Save state externally
save_checkpoint "orchestrate" "phase_1" "$ARTIFACT_PATHS_JSON"
# Load on-demand: 10,000 tokens → 500 tokens (95% reduction)
```

**Target**: <30% context usage across entire 7-phase workflow

#### Parallel Execution: Wave-Based Implementation (RECOMMENDED for plans with 3+ phases)

**Implementation**:
```bash
# Parse plan dependencies
source .claude/lib/dependency-analyzer.sh
WAVES=$(calculate_wave_structure "$PLAN_PATH")

# Execute waves (parallel within, sequential between)
for WAVE_ID in $(echo "$WAVES" | jq -r '.[] | @base64'); do
  WAVE=$(echo "$WAVE_ID" | base64 -d)
  PHASES=$(echo "$WAVE" | jq -r '.phases[]')

  # Parallel execution of wave members
  for PHASE_NUM in $PHASES; do
    invoke_implementer "$PHASE_NUM" &
  done
  wait  # Wait for wave completion before next wave
done
```

**Performance**: 40-60% time savings for plans with dependencies

#### Error Handling: Fail-Fast with 5-Component Diagnostics (MANDATORY)

**Implementation Template**:
```bash
if [ ! -f "$REQUIRED_LIBRARY" ]; then
  echo "ERROR: Required library not found: $(basename $REQUIRED_LIBRARY)"
  echo "Expected location: $REQUIRED_LIBRARY"
  echo "Diagnostic commands:"
  echo "  ls -la $(dirname $REQUIRED_LIBRARY)"
  echo "  find .claude/lib -name '$(basename $REQUIRED_LIBRARY)'"
  echo "Context: This library provides [critical functionality]"
  echo "Action: Run '/setup' to configure project structure"
  exit 1
fi
```

**Philosophy**:
- Bootstrap failures: Exit immediately, NO fallbacks
- Configuration errors: Fail-fast with diagnostics
- File creation: Verify with fallback (transient failures)
- Test failures: Enter conditional debugging phase (not errors)

#### Verification: Three-Layer Defense (MANDATORY)

**Layer 1: Agent Prompt Enforcement**
```markdown
**ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENT**: YOU MUST create report file at EXACT path provided.

**STEP 1 (REQUIRED BEFORE STEP 2)**: Create report file
**STEP 2 (REQUIRED BEFORE STEP 3)**: Verify file exists
**STEP 3 (REQUIRED BEFORE STEP 4)**: Return REPORT_CREATED signal
```

**Layer 2: Agent Behavioral File Reinforcement**
- Standard 0.5 enforcement (95+/100 quality score)
- PRIMARY OBLIGATION markers
- Completion criteria checklists

**Layer 3: Command-Level Verification + Fallback**
```bash
echo "════════════════════════════════════════════════════════"
echo "  MANDATORY VERIFICATION - Research Reports"
echo "════════════════════════════════════════════════════════"

if [ -f "$REPORT_PATH" ] && [ -s "$REPORT_PATH" ]; then
  FILE_SIZE=$(wc -c < "$REPORT_PATH")
  echo "  ✅ PASSED: Report created successfully ($FILE_SIZE bytes)"
else
  echo "  ❌ ERROR: Report file verification failed"
  echo "  DIAGNOSTIC INFORMATION:"
  echo "    - Expected path: $REPORT_PATH"
  echo "    - Parent directory: $(dirname $REPORT_PATH)"
  VERIFICATION_FAILURES=$((VERIFICATION_FAILURES + 1))
fi
```

**Target**: 100% file creation reliability

#### Workflow Scope Detection: Conditional Phase Execution (RECOMMENDED)

**Implementation**:
```bash
source .claude/lib/workflow-detection.sh

WORKFLOW_SCOPE=$(detect_workflow_scope "$WORKFLOW_DESCRIPTION")
# Result: research-only, research-and-plan, full-implementation, debug-only

# Before each phase
if ! should_run_phase "$PHASE_NUM" "$WORKFLOW_SCOPE"; then
  echo "Skipping Phase $PHASE_NUM (workflow scope: $WORKFLOW_SCOPE)"
  continue
fi
```

**Benefit**: Skip inappropriate phases, eliminate unnecessary work

#### Hierarchical Supervision: Recursive Coordination (RECOMMENDED for 5+ agents)

**Architecture**:
```
Primary Orchestrator (/orchestrate, /coordinate)
  ↓
Domain Supervisors (research-supervisor × 3 domains)
  ↓
Specialized Agents (research-specialist × 2-4 per domain)
```

**Implementation**:
```bash
# Invoke sub-supervisor for research domain
invoke_subsupervisor "research" "auth_patterns" 3  # coordinate 3 research agents
# Sub-supervisor returns aggregated metadata (150 tokens) not full reports (15,000 tokens)
```

**Scalability**:
- Flat coordination: 2-4 agents
- 2-level hierarchy: 8-16 agents (91% context reduction)
- 3-level hierarchy: 16-64 agents (maximum depth: 3)

#### Library Integration: Required Libraries (MANDATORY)

**Core Libraries**:
- `unified-location-detection.sh`: Phase 0 path calculation
- `workflow-detection.sh`: Scope detection, phase execution control
- `metadata-extraction.sh`: Context reduction utilities
- `context-pruning.sh`: Aggressive pruning between phases
- `error-handling.sh`: Fail-fast diagnostics
- `checkpoint-utils.sh`: Workflow resume, state management
- `unified-logger.sh`: Progress tracking, event logging
- `dependency-analyzer.sh`: Wave-based execution (optional, for parallel implementation)

**Library Sourcing Template**:
```bash
SCRIPT_DIR="$(cd "$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")" && pwd)"

if [ -f "$SCRIPT_DIR/../lib/library-sourcing.sh" ]; then
  source "$SCRIPT_DIR/../lib/library-sourcing.sh"
else
  echo "ERROR: Required library not found: library-sourcing.sh"
  exit 1
fi

if ! source_required_libraries "unified-location-detection.sh" "metadata-extraction.sh"; then
  exit 1
fi
```

### Implementation Sequence for Full Orchestration Workflow

**Phase 0: Path Pre-Calculation** (<1s, <11k tokens)
- Calculate all artifact paths using unified-location-detection.sh
- Lazy directory creation (no empty subdirectories)
- Verify directory structure before proceeding

**Phase 1: Research** (parallel, 4 agents, 1,000 tokens total)
- Detect workflow scope (research-only, research-and-plan, full-implementation, debug-only)
- Determine research complexity (2-4 parallel agents)
- Invoke research-specialist agents via behavioral injection
- Mandatory verification checkpoint (100% file creation reliability)
- Extract metadata only (5,000 → 250 tokens per agent, 95% reduction)
- Prune transient content (retain metadata only)
- Save checkpoint for resume capability

**Phase 2: Planning** (single agent, 300 tokens)
- Skip if workflow scope is research-only
- Forward research metadata directly (no re-summarization)
- Invoke plan-architect agent with research report paths (not content)
- Mandatory verification checkpoint
- Extract plan metadata (title, phase count, complexity, time estimates)
- Prune transient content

**Phase 3: Implementation** (wave-based parallel, 800 tokens)
- Skip if workflow scope is research-only or research-and-plan
- Parse plan dependencies using dependency-analyzer.sh
- Calculate wave structure (Kahn's algorithm)
- Execute waves (parallel within wave, sequential between waves)
- For complex phases (complexity ≥8): invoke implementation-researcher subagent
- Mandatory verification checkpoint per phase
- Extract metadata only
- Save checkpoint after each wave
- Performance: 40-60% time savings vs sequential

**Phase 4: Testing** (conditional, 500 tokens)
- Skip if workflow scope is research-only or research-and-plan
- Run project-specific tests per CLAUDE.md testing protocols
- If tests pass: proceed to Phase 6 (documentation)
- If tests fail: proceed to Phase 5 (debugging)

**Phase 5: Debugging** (conditional, 1,000 tokens)
- Only execute if Phase 4 tests fail OR workflow scope is debug-only
- Invoke debug-analyst agents for parallel root cause investigation
- Implement fixes based on debug findings
- Re-run tests
- Mandatory verification checkpoint

**Phase 6: Documentation** (single agent, 400 tokens)
- Skip if workflow scope is research-only
- Update all relevant documentation based on code changes
- Verify documentation completeness
- Extract metadata only

**Phase 7: Summary** (command-level, 200 tokens)
- Skip if workflow scope is research-only or debug-only
- Compile workflow summary (reports used, plan executed, commits created)
- Store summary in topic-based summaries/ directory
- Final checkpoint save

**Total Context Budget**: 4,200 tokens (21% context usage for 7-phase workflow)
**Performance**: 40-60% time savings through parallel execution
**Reliability**: 100% file creation, 100% bootstrap success

### Integration Priorities

**Immediate Priority (Critical)**:
1. **Phase 0 Optimization**: Replace any agent-based path calculation with unified-location-detection.sh (85% token reduction, 25x speedup)
2. **Behavioral Injection Compliance**: Audit all orchestration commands with validate-agent-invocation-pattern.sh, fix any 0% delegation patterns
3. **Metadata-Only Passing**: Enforce metadata extraction after every agent invocation (95-99% context reduction)
4. **Mandatory Verification**: Implement three-layer defense for all file creation operations (100% reliability)

**High Priority (Near-Term)**:
1. **Fail-Fast Error Handling**: Remove bootstrap fallbacks, implement 5-component diagnostics (100% bootstrap reliability)
2. **Aggressive Context Pruning**: Apply pruning after each phase completion (96% per-phase reduction)
3. **Workflow Scope Detection**: Implement conditional phase execution based on workflow type
4. **Library Integration**: Consolidate common functionality into reusable libraries

**Medium Priority (Ongoing)**:
1. **Wave-Based Parallel Execution**: Implement for plans with 3+ phases and dependency information (40-60% time savings)
2. **Hierarchical Supervision**: Use sub-supervisors for workflows with 5+ agents (91% context reduction)
3. **Checkpoint Recovery**: Enable workflow resume after interruptions
4. **Agent Performance Tracking**: Update agent registry for data-driven selection

**Low Priority (Optimization)**:
1. **Context Budget Monitoring**: Track context usage at each phase, alert if approaching limits
2. **Standards Compliance Dashboard**: Programmatic tracking of compliance across all commands
3. **Quick Reference Card**: 1-page developer reference for 13 architectural standards

## Constraints and Trade-offs

### Complexity vs Maintainability

**Constraint**: Comprehensive standards infrastructure spans 2,032 lines across multiple files, creating steep learning curve for new contributors.

**Trade-offs**:
- **Pro**: Mature, battle-tested patterns with historical validation (Specs 438, 495, 057)
- **Pro**: 100% file creation reliability, >90% delegation rates, <30% context usage
- **Con**: High upfront cognitive load to understand 13 architectural standards
- **Con**: Multiple documentation sources requiring navigation (command files, guides, references, patterns)

**Mitigation Strategies**:
1. Create 1-page quick reference card for daily development (80/20 principle)
2. Implement standards compliance dashboard for automated validation
3. Consolidate path calculation patterns into single authoritative guide
4. Renumber standards sequentially (eliminate gaps: 0, 0.5, 1-5, 11-12)

**Recommendation**: Prioritize maintainability through consolidation while preserving proven enforcement mechanisms.

### Performance vs Readability

**Constraint**: Optimizations like unified library integration and metadata extraction add abstraction layers.

**Trade-offs**:
- **Pro**: 85% token reduction, 25x speedup, 95-99% context reduction
- **Pro**: Single source of truth, consistent behavior across commands
- **Con**: Additional indirection (library sourcing, function calls)
- **Con**: Debugging requires understanding library implementations

**Mitigation Strategies**:
1. Comprehensive logging with unified-logger.sh for transparency
2. Fail-fast error handling with 5-component diagnostics for clarity
3. Function verification after library sourcing for early detection
4. Documentation of library API in guides/reference

**Recommendation**: Performance gains (25x speedup, 95% context reduction) justify abstraction overhead. Continue library-based approach with enhanced documentation.

### Enforcement Strictness vs Flexibility

**Constraint**: Imperative enforcement patterns (MUST, MANDATORY, REQUIRED) reduce flexibility for edge cases.

**Trade-offs**:
- **Pro**: 0% → >90% delegation rates through strict enforcement
- **Pro**: 100% file creation reliability through three-layer defense
- **Pro**: Predictable, consistent behavior across all commands
- **Con**: Less adaptability for non-standard workflows
- **Con**: Potential over-engineering for simple tasks

**Mitigation Strategies**:
1. Workflow scope detection for conditional phase execution
2. Standard 5 annotations guide refactoring decisions
3. Validation scripts detect violations early in development
4. Quality rubric (95+/100) allows some flexibility within guidelines

**Recommendation**: Maintain strict enforcement for core patterns (behavioral injection, metadata extraction, verification) while allowing flexibility in workflow-specific logic.

### Parallel Execution vs Determinism

**Constraint**: Wave-based parallel execution introduces non-determinism in execution order within waves.

**Trade-offs**:
- **Pro**: 40-60% time savings through parallel agent invocations
- **Pro**: Explicit dependency declarations improve plan clarity
- **Pro**: Checkpoint recovery preserves progress across interruptions
- **Con**: Harder to debug race conditions or ordering issues
- **Con**: Requires dependency analysis infrastructure (dependency-analyzer.sh)

**Mitigation Strategies**:
1. Sequential execution between waves ensures dependency satisfaction
2. Checkpoint-based recovery enables reproducibility
3. Unified logging captures parallel agent outputs with timestamps
4. Fallback to sequential execution if dependency parsing fails

**Recommendation**: Wave-based execution optional (not mandatory) - use for plans with 3+ phases and explicit dependencies. Default to sequential for simple plans.

### Context Optimization vs Information Loss

**Constraint**: Aggressive pruning and metadata extraction risk losing important details.

**Trade-offs**:
- **Pro**: 95-99% context reduction enables 10+ agent coordination
- **Pro**: <30% context usage prevents workflow failures
- **Pro**: Checkpoint-based external state preserves full content
- **Con**: Risk of pruning needed information prematurely
- **Con**: 50-word summaries may miss nuances

**Mitigation Strategies**:
1. Full artifacts stored in files (not lost, just not in context)
2. On-demand loading via load_metadata_on_demand() with caching
3. Three pruning policies: aggressive/moderate/minimal based on workflow
4. Checkpoint recovery restores full state when needed

**Recommendation**: Continue aggressive pruning for orchestration workflows (enables coordination at scale) while preserving full artifacts for on-demand access.

### Standards Fragmentation vs Comprehensive Coverage

**Constraint**: Standards split across 13 numbered standards with gaps (no standards 6-10).

**Trade-offs**:
- **Pro**: Comprehensive coverage of all architectural patterns
- **Pro**: Historical validation through three case studies
- **Pro**: Detailed enforcement mechanisms (validation scripts, checklists)
- **Con**: Non-sequential numbering creates navigation friction
- **Con**: Difficult to remember which standard covers which pattern

**Mitigation Strategies**:
1. Renumber standards sequentially (1-10) with logical grouping
2. Create quick reference card mapping patterns to standard numbers
3. Add cross-references in documentation (e.g., "See Standard 11 for behavioral injection")
4. Implement standards compliance dashboard for automated tracking

**Recommendation**: Prioritize sequential renumbering (short-term) while preserving comprehensive coverage (long-term value).
