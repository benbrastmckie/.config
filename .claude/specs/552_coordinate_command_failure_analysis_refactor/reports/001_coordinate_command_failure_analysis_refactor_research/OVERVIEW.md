## Executive Summary

The /coordinate command exhibits systematic implementation failures across four critical areas: bash eval syntax errors preventing function execution, manual placeholder substitution creating 42 points of cognitive overhead, workflow scope detection correctly functioning but poorly communicated to users, and widespread bash code block formatting anti-patterns preventing reliable execution. Root cause analysis reveals the command combines markdown instruction patterns (requiring manual Claude substitution) with bash execution expectations (requiring variable expansion), creating fundamental architectural tension. Recommended approach: (1) immediate heredoc wrapping for all function definitions (fixes eval errors), (2) pre-formatted context blocks reducing 60% of placeholder substitution, (3) improved workflow detection messaging, and (4) standardized bash block formatting removing code fences from 90% of execution-critical blocks.

## Research Structure

1. **[Bash Eval Escaped Character Errors](./001_bash_eval_escaped_character_errors.md)** - Analysis of Phase 2 verification failures caused by Claude Code's eval-based bash execution treating function definitions as escaped strings
2. **[Agent Invocation Placeholder Automation](./002_agent_invocation_placeholder_automation.md)** - Examination of 42 manual placeholder substitution instructions and automation opportunities achieving 60-100% reduction
3. **[Workflow Execution vs Presentation Logic](./003_workflow_execution_vs_presentation_logic.md)** - Investigation of research-and-plan workflow stopping after Phase 2 (working as designed but poorly communicated)
4. **[Command Architecture Code Block Formatting](./004_command_architecture_code_block_formatting.md)** - Comprehensive analysis of 35+ bash blocks with formatting issues preventing reliable execution

## Cross-Report Findings

### Pattern 1: Markdown Instructions vs Bash Execution Mismatch

All four reports identify a fundamental architectural tension in /coordinate:

**Observation**: The command is structured as markdown instructions (declarative) with embedded bash blocks, but expects both bash variable expansion (imperative) and Claude manual substitution (declarative). As noted in [Agent Invocation Placeholder Automation](./002_agent_invocation_placeholder_automation.md#architectural-difference), "/orchestrate uses imperative bash script where Claude executes entire workflow via Bash tool, allowing automatic variable expansion. /coordinate uses markdown with inline bash blocks, preventing bash expansion during Task invocations."

**Evidence**: [Bash Eval Escaped Character Errors](./001_bash_eval_escaped_character_errors.md) demonstrates function definitions fail when executed as direct bash blocks (eval treats them as escaped strings), while [Code Block Formatting](./004_command_architecture_code_block_formatting.md) shows 88% of bash blocks are code-fenced (documentation pattern) but should be directly executable.

**Impact**: Variables defined in Phase 0 are unavailable in later phases, functions must be redefined or fail to execute, and 42 placeholder substitutions create repetitive manual work.

### Pattern 2: Working Verification Patterns Exist But Misapplied

Multiple reports reference the same working pattern (heredoc with pipe to bash) but note inconsistent application:

**Working Pattern** (from [Bash Eval Errors](./001_bash_eval_escaped_character_errors.md#working-pattern-line-137)):
```bash
cat <<'VERIFY_PLAN' | bash
  PLAN_PATH="/absolute/path"
  if [ -f "$PLAN_PATH" ] && [ -s "$PLAN_PATH" ]; then
    echo '✓'
  fi
VERIFY_PLAN
```

**Broken Pattern** (same report, lines 58-96): Function definitions without heredoc wrapper → escaped as text → syntax errors.

**Synergy**: [Code Block Formatting](./004_command_architecture_code_block_formatting.md#finding-4) identifies the root cause: "Pattern A (Direct Bash Execution) vs Pattern B (Bash Heredoc Example)" - command confuses executable code with documentation examples.

### Pattern 3: Automation Opportunities Constrained by Execution Model

[Agent Invocation Placeholder Automation](./002_agent_invocation_placeholder_automation.md) proposes three automation approaches (bash-side template expansion, Claude-native variable expansion, inline agent invocation), but concludes only Approach 2 (pre-formatted contexts) is feasible without architectural conversion.

**Key Constraint**: "Bash cannot invoke Task tool (only Claude can), so helper functions can only generate text and print to stdout."

**Supporting Evidence**: [Code Block Formatting](./004_command_architecture_code_block_formatting.md#finding-3) documents variable scoping issues between bash blocks: "Each Bash tool invocation creates new shell, variables don't persist."

**Implication**: 100% automation requires converting /coordinate to /orchestrate's execution model (bash-native script), but 60% reduction achievable with current architecture via pre-formatted context blocks.

### Pattern 4: User Experience Issues Stem from Working Code

[Workflow Execution vs Presentation Logic](./003_workflow_execution_vs_presentation_logic.md) reveals the only area where code works perfectly (workflow scope detection and phase execution gating), but users experience confusion because:

1. "research...to create plan...to implement" triggers "research-and-plan" (stops before implementation)
2. Command displays "Workflow complete" without clarifying implementation was skipped
3. Workflow name doesn't communicate stopping point

**Contradiction**: All other reports focus on broken code patterns; this report shows perfectly functioning code with poor UX messaging.

**Recommended Fix**: Enhanced detection pattern for compound workflows and clearer completion messages ("⚠️ NOTE: Implementation was NOT executed").

## Detailed Findings by Topic

### 1. Bash Eval Escaped Character Errors

**Summary**: Claude Code's eval-based bash execution mechanism escapes function definitions, special characters, and variable substitutions when code blocks lack heredoc delimiters. Phase 2 verification fails with syntax errors because `verify_file_created()` function definition is treated as literal text (`verify_file_created ( ) \{`) rather than executable code. The heredoc pattern (`cat <<'DELIMITER' | bash`) successfully bypasses eval mechanism by piping literal text to fresh bash shell.

**Key Findings**:
- Error pattern: `eval: line 1: syntax error near unexpected token '('`
- Escaped characters: `\$`, `\{`, `\}`, `\[`, `\]` indicate string escaping
- Function definitions as text: `local file_path\=` shows variable substitution failed
- Working solution exists: Line 137 uses heredoc successfully (same verification logic, clean execution)

**Recommendations**:
1. Wrap all function definitions in heredoc (`cat <<'DELIMITER' | bash`)
2. Use heredoc for any bash block with: functions, test expressions `[`, control flow, >3 lines
3. Update /coordinate standards (lines 750-813) to include heredoc wrapper

[Full Report](./001_bash_eval_escaped_character_errors.md)

### 2. Agent Invocation Placeholder Automation

**Summary**: The /coordinate command requires manual substitution of 42 placeholders across 12 "EXECUTE NOW" blocks where Claude must replace `${VARIABLE_NAME}` and `[substitute X]` patterns with values calculated in Phase 0. Analysis reveals 60-70% reduction potential through bash-side pre-formatting of context blocks, though 100% automation requires architectural shift to bash-native execution like /orchestrate. Current pattern creates array indexing math (`REPORT_PATHS[$i-1]`), loop context tracking, and variable expansion memory burden for orchestrator.

**Key Findings**:
- 42 "substitute" instructions across 8-21 agent invocations per workflow
- Three automation approaches: bash template expansion (not feasible - envsubst unavailable), pre-formatted contexts (60% reduction), bash-native execution (100% automation but requires rewrite)
- /orchestrate achieves 70% automation through bash variable expansion in executed script context
- Critical constraint: bash cannot invoke Task tool, limiting automation without architectural change

**Recommendations**:
1. **Short-term** (Approach 2): Pre-format 6 context blocks in Phase 0 (RESEARCH_CONTEXTS[], PLAN_CONTEXT, etc.) reducing 42→17 instructions
2. **Long-term** (Approach 3): Convert to bash-native execution pattern matching /orchestrate (100% automation, 8-12 hour effort)
3. Complete function verification before first usage to prevent runtime errors

### 3. Workflow Execution vs Presentation Logic

**Summary**: Workflow scope detection correctly identifies four patterns (research-only, research-and-plan, full-implementation, debug-only) and sets phase execution gates accordingly. The research-and-plan workflow intentionally stops after Phase 2 (Planning) as designed, displaying completion summary with instruction to run `/implement [plan-path]` separately. The observed "bug" is actually correct behavior with poor user messaging - users requesting "research...to create plan...to implement" expect automatic continuation but receive only research and planning phases.

**Key Findings**:
- Workflow detection functions correctly: compound pattern "research...plan...implement" matches "research-and-plan" (stops before Phase 3)
- Phase execution gates work: `should_run_phase 3` returns false for research-and-plan, triggering exit at line 1187
- Completion message lacks clarity: "Workflow complete" doesn't explain implementation was skipped
- Working code, poor UX: Only area where implementation is bug-free but user experience suffers

**Recommendations**:
1. Add compound pattern detection for "research...plan...implement" → full-implementation workflow
2. Add --scope parameter for explicit override: `/coordinate "..." --scope=full-implementation`
3. Enhance completion messages: "⚠️ NOTE: Implementation was NOT executed (workflow: research-and-plan)"
4. Document workflow pattern decision tree in command file

### 4. Command Architecture and Code Block Formatting

**Summary**: The /coordinate command contains ~35 bash code blocks with widespread formatting issues: 88% are code-fenced (documentation pattern) but should be directly executable, missing function definitions scattered across phases instead of consolidated in Phase 0, and variable scoping issues between disconnected bash blocks. Critical distinction identified: bash blocks marked "EXECUTE NOW" should use direct Bash tool invocation (Pattern A), not heredoc examples (Pattern B). Recommended refactor: remove code fences from execution-critical blocks, consolidate 4 inline function definitions to Phase 0, export all variables immediately after definition, and add comprehensive error handling with `set -e`.

**Key Findings**:
- 88% of bash blocks code-fenced (should be <5% for execution-critical code)
- Only 4 "EXECUTE NOW" markers for 35 bash blocks (unclear which are executable vs examples)
- Function definitions scattered: `verify_file_created()` lines 755-813, `display_brief_summary()` lines 573-602 (should be Phase 0)
- Variable scoping failures: arrays lost between Bash tool invocations, scalars not exported
- Monolithic blocks: Phase 0 STEP 0 spans 79 lines mixing library sourcing + function definition + verification

**Recommendations**:
1. **CRITICAL**: Remove code fences from 90% of blocks, add "EXECUTE NOW" markers
2. **HIGH**: Consolidate all function definitions to Phase 0 STEP 0B with explicit exports
3. **HIGH**: Export scalars immediately, convert arrays to space-separated strings or file-based state
4. **MEDIUM**: Complete function verification (11 functions: 7 library + 4 inline)
5. **MEDIUM**: Add `set -e` to critical blocks and explicit error handling
6. **LOW**: Separate infrastructure setup (Phase 0A-C) from workflow logic (Phase 1+)

## Recommended Approach

### Phase 1: Critical Fixes (Immediate - Sprint 1, ~4-6 hours)

**Goal**: Make /coordinate functional for basic workflows with minimal refactor.

1. **Fix Bash Eval Errors** (from Report 1):
   - Wrap all function definitions in heredoc pattern
   - Target files: coordinate.md lines 755-813 (verify_file_created), 573-602 (display_brief_summary)
   - Validation: Test function availability in later phases

2. **Standardize Bash Block Formatting** (from Report 4, Rec 1):
   - Remove code fences from execution-critical blocks (88%→5%)
   - Add "EXECUTE NOW" markers to 30+ blocks
   - Keep code fences only for documentation examples

3. **Improve Workflow Completion Messaging** (from Report 3):
   - Add warning to research-and-plan completion: "⚠️ Implementation NOT executed"
   - Clarify next steps: "Run: /implement $PLAN_PATH"

**Success Criteria**:
- Phase 2 verification executes without syntax errors
- Functions available across all phases
- Users understand why implementation didn't run

### Phase 2: Efficiency Improvements (Short-Term - Sprint 2, ~3-4 hours)

**Goal**: Reduce cognitive overhead for orchestrator via automation.

1. **Pre-Formatted Context Blocks** (from Report 2, Rec 1):
   - Add Phase 0 context pre-formatting: RESEARCH_CONTEXTS[], PLAN_CONTEXT, IMPL_CONTEXT, etc.
   - Reduce 42→17 placeholder substitutions (60% reduction)
   - Eliminate array indexing math from Claude's responsibility

2. **Consolidate Function Definitions** (from Report 4, Rec 2):
   - Move all helper functions to Phase 0 STEP 0B
   - Export with `export -f` for availability in later phases
   - Verify all 11 functions before workflow execution

3. **Enhanced Workflow Detection** (from Report 3, Rec 1):
   - Add compound pattern: "research...plan...implement" → full-implementation
   - Add --scope override parameter
   - Document decision tree in command file

**Success Criteria**:
- Orchestrator substitutes <20 placeholders (down from 42)
- No array indexing calculations required
- Compound workflows auto-detect correctly

### Phase 3: Architectural Optimization (Long-Term - Sprint 3-4, ~8-12 hours, optional)

**Goal**: Achieve 100% automation through architectural alignment with /orchestrate.

1. **Convert to Bash-Native Execution** (from Report 2, Rec 2):
   - Rewrite /coordinate from markdown instructions → bash script execution
   - Move Task invocations inside bash `for` loops with `${VAR}` expansion
   - Leverage /orchestrate pattern as reference (lines 860-900)

2. **Implement State Persistence** (from Report 4, Rec 3):
   - Export all scalar variables immediately after definition
   - Convert arrays to file-based state or exported strings
   - Use checkpoint files for complex state

3. **Comprehensive Error Handling** (from Report 4, Rec 5):
   - Add `set -e` to all critical bash blocks
   - Implement fail-fast pattern: `|| { echo "ERROR"; exit 1; }`
   - Log errors to unified-logger

**Success Criteria**:
- Zero manual placeholder substitution required
- Variables persist across all phases
- Fail-fast on first error with clear diagnostics

## Constraints and Trade-offs

### Constraint 1: Bash Tool Execution Model

**Issue**: Each Bash tool invocation creates new shell context, variables and functions don't persist unless explicitly exported or sourced.

**Impact**: Makes Phase 0 variable definitions unavailable in later phases without explicit state management.

**Mitigation**: Export scalars immediately, use file-based state for arrays, consolidate function definitions with export.

**Trade-off**: File-based state adds I/O overhead, export pattern adds verbosity to code.

### Constraint 2: Task Tool Invocation from Bash

**Issue**: Only Claude (LLM) can invoke Task tool - bash scripts cannot directly invoke agents.

**Impact**: Limits automation to 60-70% without architectural conversion to bash-native execution (where Claude executes entire bash script via Bash tool).

**Mitigation**: Pre-format context blocks in bash, Claude performs simple substitution. Alternative: full conversion to /orchestrate pattern.

**Trade-off**: Pre-formatting achieves 60% reduction with minimal refactor but leaves repetitive work. Full conversion achieves 100% automation but requires 8-12 hours of rewrite.

### Constraint 3: Backward Compatibility vs Clean Break

**Issue**: /coordinate has established usage patterns - breaking changes may disrupt existing workflows.

**Impact**: Users may have scripts or documentation referencing current command syntax/behavior.

**Mitigation**: Document migration path, maintain old command as /coordinate-legacy during transition.

**Trade-off**: Per project philosophy ("clean-break, fail-fast evolution"), should delete obsolete patterns immediately. However, /coordinate is in active use - staged migration may be prudent.

### Constraint 4: Heredoc Quoting and Variable Expansion

**Issue**: Heredocs with single quotes (`<<'DELIMITER'`) prevent variable expansion, double quotes (`<<"DELIMITER"`) enable expansion but require careful escaping.

**Impact**: When using heredoc for function definitions, must choose between:
- Single quotes: No variable expansion (safest, most explicit)
- Double quotes: Variable expansion (flexible but error-prone with special characters)

**Mitigation**: Use single quotes for function definitions (no expansion needed), double quotes only when template requires pre-calculated values.

**Trade-off**: Single quotes require variables to be passed as function arguments (more verbose), double quotes risk escaping bugs.

### Risk Factor 1: Eval Behavior Assumptions

**Observation**: Reports assume Claude Code's Bash tool uses eval-based execution causing escaped characters.

**Risk**: If Bash tool implementation changes, heredoc solution may become unnecessary or insufficient.

**Mitigation**: Test refactored patterns on current Claude Code version, document assumptions for future maintenance.

### Risk Factor 2: Scope Creep in Architectural Refactor

**Observation**: Phase 3 recommendations (bash-native conversion) involve 8-12 hours of work with potential for regressions.

**Risk**: May introduce new bugs in verification, checkpoint handling, or agent invocation reliability.

**Mitigation**: Implement Phase 1-2 first, validate in production, defer Phase 3 until proven necessary. Use /orchestrate as reference to avoid reinventing patterns.

### Risk Factor 3: Testing Coverage

**Observation**: Reports recommend extensive refactoring but don't specify comprehensive test plan.

**Risk**: Changes may pass initial validation but fail in edge cases (2 topics vs 4 topics, debug iterations, partial failures).

**Mitigation**: Create test matrix covering:
- Workflow types: research-only, research-and-plan, full-implementation, debug-only
- Complexity levels: 2, 3, 4 research topics
- Failure scenarios: test failures triggering debug loop (0, 1, 3 iterations)
- State transitions: verify checkpoint save/restore across phases

## Integration Notes

### Dependencies on Existing Libraries

All recommendations assume these libraries remain available and functional:

- `.claude/lib/unified-location-detection.sh` - Path calculation (Phase 0)
- `.claude/lib/workflow-detection.sh` - Scope detection and phase gating (Phase 0)
- `.claude/lib/checkpoint-utils.sh` - State persistence (all phases)
- `.claude/lib/unified-logger.sh` - Error logging (all phases)
- `.claude/lib/error-handling.sh` - Fail-fast patterns (all phases)

**Validation**: Phase 0 STEP 0 currently verifies 5 of these libraries (lines 548-569) but should expand to verify all 7 libraries plus 4 inline functions (see Report 4, Rec 4).

### Impact on Other Commands

Changes to /coordinate may inform improvements to sibling commands:

- **/orchestrate** (5,438 lines): Already uses bash-native execution, can provide reference patterns for /coordinate Phase 3 refactor
- **/supervise** (1,939 lines): Minimal orchestration (2 Task invocations), may benefit from same bash block formatting standards
- **Future orchestration commands**: Should adopt standardized patterns emerging from this refactor

### Coordination with Standards Documentation

Multiple reports reference command architecture standards - updates needed:

- `.claude/docs/reference/command_architecture_standards.md` - Add bash block formatting patterns (Report 4)
- `.claude/docs/guides/command-development-guide.md` - Add bash execution patterns guide (Report 1, Rec 3)
- `.claude/docs/guides/bash-execution-patterns.md` - New guide covering heredoc usage, eval errors, variable scoping (Report 1, Rec 3)
