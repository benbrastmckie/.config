## Overview

The /coordinate command (2,148 lines) provides wave-based parallel execution achieving 40-60% time savings over sequential workflows. **Execution validation confirms best practices are already successfully implemented** - this plan shifts from fixing anti-patterns to **polish and optimization** for better user experience and quantifiable efficiency gains.

**Validation Results** (from coordinate_output.md):
- ‚úÖ 100% file creation rate (3/3 research agents succeeded)
- ‚úÖ Zero SlashCommand usage (pure Task tool delegation)
- ‚úÖ Imperative agent invocation working correctly
- ‚úÖ All verification checkpoints passed
- ‚úÖ Graceful error recovery demonstrated

**Focus Areas for Optimization**:
1. **User Experience**: Enhance progress visibility for parallel execution, optimize output formatting
2. **Performance Quantification**: Add instrumentation to measure and report efficiency gains
3. **Edge Case Hardening**: Strengthen error messaging and recovery for uncommon scenarios
4. **Decision Support**: Document when to use /coordinate vs /supervise vs /orchestrate
5. **Efficiency Validation**: Prove <30% context usage and 40-60% time savings claims

## Research Summary

Key findings from research reports:

**From Orchestrator Best Practices (Report 001)**:
- Imperative agent invocation pattern achieves >90% delegation rate (vs 0% with documentation-only YAML)
- Three-layer verification defense achieves 100% file creation reliability
- Metadata extraction provides 95% context reduction (5,000 ‚Üí 250 tokens)
- Fail-fast error handling with 5-component messages enables rapid debugging
- Unified location detection provides 85% token reduction and 25x speedup

**From /coordinate Analysis (Report 002)**:
- 2,148 lines total, 18% larger than /supervise due to wave-based infrastructure
- Wave-based execution adds ~330 lines but provides 40-60% time savings
- Phases 4-6 (Testing, Debug, Documentation) identical to /supervise - consolidation opportunity
- Dependency-analyzer.sh library (639 lines) implements Kahn's algorithm for wave calculation
- All verification patterns follow fail-fast philosophy with comprehensive diagnostics

**From Execution Validation (coordinate_output.md)**:
- ‚úÖ Real-world execution confirms best practices already implemented
- ‚úÖ 3 parallel research agents completed successfully (100% file creation rate)
- ‚úÖ All verification checkpoints passed without failures
- ‚úÖ Task tool used exclusively (zero SlashCommand usage detected)
- ‚úÖ Imperative agent invocation patterns working correctly
- ‚úÖ Graceful recovery from initial script execution issue (fail-fast worked)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Minor: Initial heredoc execution attempt failed, required adjustment
- üí° Opportunity: Output formatting could be more concise for better UX
- üí° Opportunity: Progress visibility could highlight parallel agent execution better

**Revised Approach**:
Since execution validation shows /coordinate already implements core best practices successfully, shift focus from fixing anti-patterns to **polish and optimization**:
1. Enhance progress visibility for parallel execution (user experience)
2. Optimize output formatting for minimal, well-formatted user feedback
3. Add performance instrumentation to quantify efficiency gains
4. Strengthen error messaging for edge cases
5. Document decision criteria for when to use /coordinate vs other orchestrators

## Success Criteria

- [ ] All agent invocations use imperative pattern (no documentation-only YAML blocks)
- [ ] File creation reliability: 100% (verified via test suite)
- [ ] Context usage: <30% throughout 7-phase workflow
- [ ] Wave-based execution preserved (40-60% time savings maintained)
- [ ] Enhanced error messages with 5-component structure
- [ ] Performance instrumentation for context and wave execution metrics
- [ ] Validation tests for anti-pattern detection
- [ ] Documentation updated with decision criteria and best practices

## Technical Design

### Architecture Principles

1. **Preserve Wave-Based Differentiation**: Maintain Phase 3 wave-based infrastructure as core value proposition
2. **Apply Unified Standards**: Implement patterns from spec 497 across all orchestration commands
3. **Optimize Context Management**: Aggressive pruning and metadata extraction for <30% target
4. **Fail-Fast Philosophy**: Enhanced error messages, no silent degradation
5. **Performance Visibility**: Instrumentation for context usage and wave execution metrics

### Component Interactions

```
Phase 0 (Location)
  ‚Üì [Unified location detection library]
Phase 1 (Research)
  ‚Üì [Parallel agents with metadata extraction]
Phase 2 (Planning)
  ‚Üì [Plan-architect with research synthesis]
Phase 3 (Wave Implementation) ‚Üê DIFFERENTIATOR
  ‚Üì [Dependency analysis ‚Üí Wave calculation ‚Üí Parallel execution]
Phase 4 (Testing)
  ‚Üì [Test-specialist with results verification]
Phase 5 (Debug - conditional)
  ‚Üì [Debug-analyst with iterative fixes]
Phase 6 (Documentation - conditional)
  ‚Üì [Doc-writer with summary creation]

Performance Instrumentation Layer:
  - Context size tracking at phase boundaries
  - Wave execution metrics (parallel phases, time saved)
  - File creation verification logging
  - Error classification and recovery tracking
```

### Key Design Decisions

1. **Maintain Phase 3 Uniqueness**: Wave-based execution stays as /coordinate's differentiation
2. **Consolidate Phases 4-6**: Extract to shared library for consistency with /supervise
3. **Enhanced Progress Markers**: Wave-specific visibility (Wave 1/4 starting, N phases parallel)
4. **Performance Instrumentation**: Context usage and wave metrics logged for validation
5. **Anti-Pattern Validation**: Add to test suite for regression prevention

## Risk Management

### Technical Risks
1. **Risk**: Context optimization may impact wave execution visibility
   - **Mitigation**: Preserve wave metadata until Phase 3 completion, test visibility
   - **Fallback**: Adjust pruning policy to retain more wave details if needed

2. **Risk**: Enhanced verification may add unacceptable overhead
   - **Mitigation**: Benchmark verification time, optimize checks
   - **Fallback**: Simplify checks while maintaining 100% reliability

3. **Risk**: Wave execution tests may be complex to implement
   - **Mitigation**: Start with simple test cases, expand incrementally
   - **Fallback**: Focus on integration tests if unit tests prove difficult

### Process Risks
1. **Risk**: Improvements may introduce regressions in existing functionality
   - **Mitigation**: Comprehensive testing before and after each phase
   - **Fallback**: Git revert to previous working state

2. **Risk**: Documentation updates may become outdated quickly
   - **Mitigation**: Update documentation inline with code changes
   - **Fallback**: Mark documentation sections as "provisional" until stabilized

## Timeline Estimates

- **Phase 0**: 1 hour (validation and baseline) - *Reduced: validation already complete*
- **Phase 1**: 2-3 hours (output formatting and UX enhancement) - *Changed focus from agent patterns*
- **Phase 2**: 2-3 hours (context management)
- **Phase 3**: 2 hours (verification enhancement)
- **Phase 4**: 2 hours (error handling)
- **Phase 5**: 3-4 hours (wave execution enhancement)
- **Phase 6**: 2 hours (performance instrumentation)
- **Phase 7**: 2 hours (documentation)

**Total Estimated Time**: 11-16 hours (revised from 12-16 hours)

**Parallel Execution Opportunities**:
- Phases 1, 2, 3 can be implemented in Wave 1 (no dependencies)
- Phase 4 can start after Phase 3 completes
- Phases 5 and 6 can run in parallel after Phase 2 completes
- Phase 7 must wait for all other phases

**Wave-Based Timeline**:
- Wave 1: Phases 1, 2, 3 (max 3 hours)
- Wave 2: Phase 4 (2 hours)
- Wave 3: Phases 5, 6 (max 4 hours)
- Wave 4: Phase 7 (2 hours)

**Wave-Based Total**: 11 hours (vs 16 hours sequential, ~30% time savings)

## Approval and Sign-Off

## Revision History

### 2025-10-28 - Revision 1: Execution Validation Integration

**Changes Made**:
1. **Phase 0 Updated**: Marked 4 validation tasks as complete based on real-world execution evidence
   - ‚úÖ Agent invocation patterns validated (Task tool used exclusively)
   - ‚úÖ File creation reliability confirmed (100% success rate)
   - ‚úÖ SlashCommand usage checked (zero detected)
   - ‚úÖ Verification checkpoints validated (all passed)

2. **Phase 1 Restructured**: Changed focus from "Agent Invocation Pattern Enhancement" to "Output Formatting and User Experience Enhancement"
   - **Reason**: Execution validation proves agent patterns already work correctly
   - **New Focus**: Optimize output for minimal, well-formatted user feedback
   - **Key Tasks**: Progress visibility, output verbosity reduction, quiet mode option

3. **Overview Updated**: Added validation results section documenting successful execution
   - Confirms best practices already implemented
   - Shifts plan focus from fixing anti-patterns to polish/optimization

4. **Research Summary Extended**: Added "From Execution Validation" section
   - Documents real-world execution results from coordinate_output.md
   - Identifies optimization opportunities (output formatting, progress visibility)
   - Confirms graceful error recovery and fail-fast behavior working

5. **Timeline Adjusted**: Reduced Phase 0 from 1-2 hours to 1 hour
   - Validation already complete, only quantification remains
   - Total timeline: 11-16 hours (revised from 12-16 hours)

**Reason for Revision**:
Real-world execution output (/home/benjamin/.config/.claude/specs/coordinate_output.md) demonstrates that /coordinate already implements core orchestrator best practices successfully. The command:
- Uses Task tool exclusively (no SlashCommand anti-pattern)
- Achieves 100% file creation reliability
- Implements imperative agent invocation correctly
- Handles errors gracefully with recovery

This evidence shifts the improvement plan from "fixing anti-patterns" to "polish and optimization" - focusing on user experience, output formatting, and quantifying efficiency gains.

**Reports Used**:
- /home/benjamin/.config/.claude/specs/coordinate_output.md (execution validation)
- /home/benjamin/.config/.claude/specs/506_research_best_practices_for_orchestrator_commands_/reports/001_orchestrator_best_practices.md
- /home/benjamin/.config/.claude/specs/506_research_best_practices_for_orchestrator_commands_/reports/002_coordinate_command_analysis.md

**Modified Phases**:
- Phase 0: Validation and Baseline Measurement (4 tasks marked complete, duration reduced)
- Phase 1: Complete restructure from agent patterns to output formatting/UX

**Impact**:
- ‚úÖ More accurate plan reflecting current implementation state
- ‚úÖ Better focus on actual improvement opportunities
- ‚úÖ Reduced Phase 0 effort (validation already done)
- ‚úÖ New Phase 1 directly addresses user request for "minimal, well-formatted output"
