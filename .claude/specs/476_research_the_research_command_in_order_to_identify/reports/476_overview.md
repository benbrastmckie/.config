# Research Overview: /research Command Optimization Analysis

## Executive Summary

This comprehensive research analyzed the `/research` command (584 lines) across three dimensions: implementation architecture, standards compliance, and optimization opportunities. The command demonstrates strong foundational patterns—hierarchical multi-agent coordination, lazy directory creation, and 40-60% time savings through parallel execution—but has critical gaps in enforcement mechanisms and context management. Key findings reveal: (1) Missing mandatory verification checkpoints and fallback mechanisms reduce file creation reliability from potential 100% to ~80%, (2) Behavioral content duplication violates Standard 12, creating 90% code bloat and maintenance burden, (3) Weak imperative language undermines execution certainty, and (4) Unused metadata extraction libraries leave 95% context reduction potential untapped. Implementation of Priority 1 optimizations (8-11 hours effort) would achieve 100% file creation reliability, 95% context reduction, and Standard 0/12 compliance while reducing command file size by 21%.

**UPDATE (2025-10-26)**: Real-world testing revealed two critical runtime failures requiring immediate fixes: (1) Directory detection fails with bash eval syntax errors due to complex quoting in unified-location-detection.sh call, and (2) Research synthesizer returns metadata but orchestrator ignores it and reads the full OVERVIEW.md file instead, defeating the forward message pattern. See "Real-World Execution Errors" section below for details.

## Real-World Execution Errors (Critical Fixes Required)

### Issue 1: Directory Detection Fails with Bash Eval Syntax Error

**Severity**: Critical (workflow fails at Step 2, before any research occurs)

**Error Context** (from TODO.md lines 21-45):
```
Bash(source .claude/lib/unified-location-detection.sh && RESEARCH_TOPIC="should the
      display_brief_summary function be defined els…)
  ⎿  Error: /run/current-system/sw/bin/bash: eval: line 1: syntax error near unexpected
     token `perform_location_detection'
```

**Root Cause Analysis**:
1. `/research` command (lines 92-107) attempts to source unified-location-detection.sh AND call perform_location_detection() in a single Bash tool invocation
2. The complex command includes nested variable substitution `${CLAUDE_CONFIG:-${HOME}/.config}`, multiple quotes, and command substitution `$(...)`
3. When Claude Code's Bash tool wraps this in an eval statement, the quote escaping and special character handling breaks
4. The library is sourced successfully but the function call fails because bash state doesn't persist between separate Bash tool invocations

**Why /supervise Works But /research Fails**:
- `/supervise` uses simpler approach (research.md:86-116 vs supervise.md equivalent):
  ```bash
  source "$SCRIPT_DIR/../lib/topic-utils.sh"
  TOPIC_NUM=$(get_next_topic_number "$SPECS_ROOT")
  TOPIC_NAME=$(sanitize_topic_name "$WORKFLOW_DESCRIPTION")
  ```
- Each function call is simple with minimal quoting complexity
- No nested variable substitution or complex path resolution

**Observed Workaround** (from TODO.md lines 56-69):
The orchestrator falls back to the simpler approach:
```bash
source .claude/lib/topic-utils.sh
source .claude/lib/detect-project-dir.sh
PROJECT_ROOT="${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}"
SPECS_ROOT="${PROJECT_ROOT}/.claude/specs"
TOPIC_NUM=$(get_next_topic_number "$SPECS_ROOT")
TOPIC_NAME=$(sanitize_topic_name "$WORKFLOW_DESCRIPTION")
```

This succeeds every time.

**Solution**:
Replace STEP 2 (lines 86-179 in research.md) with the simpler approach used by /supervise:

```bash
### STEP 2 (REQUIRED BEFORE STEP 3) - Path Pre-Calculation

**EXECUTE NOW - Calculate Absolute Paths for All Subtopic Reports**

**Step 1: Get or Create Main Topic Directory**
```bash
# Source unified location detection utilities
source .claude/lib/topic-utils.sh
source .claude/lib/detect-project-dir.sh

# Get project root (from environment or git)
PROJECT_ROOT="${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}"
if [ -z "$PROJECT_ROOT" ]; then
  echo "ERROR: CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR not set"
  exit 1
fi

# Determine specs directory
if [ -d "${PROJECT_ROOT}/.claude/specs" ]; then
  SPECS_ROOT="${PROJECT_ROOT}/.claude/specs"
elif [ -d "${PROJECT_ROOT}/specs" ]; then
  SPECS_ROOT="${PROJECT_ROOT}/specs"
else
  SPECS_ROOT="${PROJECT_ROOT}/.claude/specs"
  mkdir -p "$SPECS_ROOT"
fi

# Calculate topic metadata
TOPIC_NUM=$(get_next_topic_number "$SPECS_ROOT")
TOPIC_NAME=$(sanitize_topic_name "$RESEARCH_TOPIC")
TOPIC_DIR="${SPECS_ROOT}/${TOPIC_NUM}_${TOPIC_NAME}"

# Create topic root directory
mkdir -p "$TOPIC_DIR"

# MANDATORY VERIFICATION checkpoint
if [ ! -d "$TOPIC_DIR" ]; then
  echo "ERROR: Topic directory creation failed: $TOPIC_DIR"
  exit 1
fi

echo "✓ VERIFIED: Topic directory created at $TOPIC_DIR"
```
```

**Impact**:
- Eliminates 100% of directory detection failures
- Uses battle-tested utilities from /supervise (zero reported failures)
- Reduces code complexity (93 lines → 35 lines, 62% reduction)
- Maintains same functionality (topic numbering, sanitization, directory creation)

**Effort**: Low (1-2 hours to replace and test)

### Issue 2: Research Synthesizer Output Ignored (Orchestrator Reads Full File)

**Severity**: High (defeats forward message pattern, wastes context, inefficient)

**Observed Behavior** (from TODO.md lines 129-140):
```
● Perfect! Now let me read a portion of the OVERVIEW to provide you with the key findings:

● Read(.claude/specs/477_[...]/OVERVIEW.md)
  ⎿  Read 100 lines

● Perfect! Let me read the recommendations section:

● Read(.claude/specs/477_[...]/OVERVIEW.md)
  ⎿  Read 80 lines

● Excellent! Now let me display the final summary to you:
```

The orchestrator (Claude executing /research command):
1. Receives `OVERVIEW_CREATED: /path/to/OVERVIEW.md` from research-synthesizer agent
2. **Ignores** the `OVERVIEW_SUMMARY:` and `METADATA:` fields returned by agent
3. Reads OVERVIEW.md using Read tool (180 lines across 2 calls)
4. Manually extracts and reformats the summary to display to user

**Expected Behavior** (per research-synthesizer.md lines 179-218):
Research-synthesizer returns:
```
OVERVIEW_CREATED: /absolute/path/to/OVERVIEW.md

OVERVIEW_SUMMARY:
[100-word summary for context reduction]

METADATA:
- Reports Synthesized: 4
- Cross-Report Patterns: 3
- Recommended Approach: [brief description]
- Critical Constraints: [if any]
```

Orchestrator should:
1. Parse `OVERVIEW_SUMMARY` from agent output
2. Display summary directly to user (forward message pattern)
3. **Never read** OVERVIEW.md file (file is for user reference, not orchestrator)

**Root Cause**:
The `/research` command has **no Step 7** to display results to user. The command ends at line 584 with "Let me begin researching your topic using the hierarchical multi-agent pattern." After Step 6 (cross-reference updates), there's no instruction for what to do with the research-synthesizer's OVERVIEW_SUMMARY output.

**Solution**:
Add STEP 7 after line 446 (after spec-updater step):

```markdown
### STEP 7 (REQUIRED) - Display Research Summary to User

**EXECUTE NOW - Parse and Display Research-Synthesizer Output**

**After research-synthesizer completes**, extract metadata from agent output and display to user.

**Step 7.1: Parse Agent Output**

The research-synthesizer agent returns structured metadata. Extract it:

```bash
# Parse overview path (already captured earlier)
OVERVIEW_PATH="${RESEARCH_SUBDIR}/OVERVIEW.md"

# Extract summary from agent output (research-synthesizer returns this)
# Agent output format:
# OVERVIEW_CREATED: /path
#
# OVERVIEW_SUMMARY:
# [100-word summary]
#
# METADATA:
# - Reports Synthesized: N
# - Cross-Report Patterns: M
# ...

# The OVERVIEW_SUMMARY is already in agent output - no need to read file
```

**Step 7.2: Display Summary to User**

**CRITICAL**: DO NOT read OVERVIEW.md file. The research-synthesizer already provided the summary.

Display to user:
```
✓ Research Complete!

Research artifacts created in: $TOPIC_DIR/reports/001_[research_name]/

Overview Report: OVERVIEW.md
- [Display OVERVIEW_SUMMARY from agent output]

Subtopic Reports: [N] reports
- [List from VERIFIED_PATHS]

Next Steps:
- Review OVERVIEW.md for complete synthesis
- Use individual reports for detailed findings
- Create implementation plan: /plan [feature] --reports [OVERVIEW_PATH]
```

**RETURN_FORMAT_SPECIFIED**: Display summary, paths, and next steps. DO NOT read any report files.
```

**Impact**:
- **Eliminates** 2 unnecessary Read tool calls (180 lines of file content)
- **Achieves** 99% context reduction (as intended by forward message pattern)
- **Maintains** same user experience (summary displayed at end)
- **Respects** agent behavioral design (research-synthesizer returns metadata for this purpose)

**Effort**: Low (1-2 hours to add step and adjust final message)

---

### Issue 3: Verification Bash Commands Fail with Complex Loops

**Severity**: Medium (fallback succeeds but errors are noisy)

**Error Context** (from TODO.md lines 90-100):
```
● Bash(RESEARCH_SUBDIR="[...]" && echo "Ve…)
  ⎿  Error: /run/current-system/sw/bin/bash: eval: line 1: syntax error near unexpected token `find'
     /run/current-system/sw/bin/bash: eval: line 1: `RESEARCH_SUBDIR=[...] && echo 'Verifying
     subtopic reports...' && for i in 001 002 003 004 ; do REPORT\=\$ ( find '' -name _\*.md ...
```

**Root Cause**:
STEP 4 verification (lines 251-290) uses complex bash with:
- For loops iterating over subtopics
- Command substitution inside loops `$(find ...)`
- Variable assignments with `$(basename ...)`
- Nested if statements

When wrapped in Bash tool's eval, the quote escaping breaks.

**Observed Workaround** (TODO.md lines 101-110):
```bash
ls -la /path/to/research/directory/*.md
```

Simple ls command succeeds every time.

**Solution**:
Simplify STEP 4 verification (lines 251-290) to use basic commands:

```bash
# Instead of complex loop with find and basename:
for subtopic in "${!SUBTOPIC_REPORT_PATHS[@]}"; do
  EXPECTED_PATH="${SUBTOPIC_REPORT_PATHS[$subtopic]}"
  if [ -f "$EXPECTED_PATH" ]; then
    echo "✓ Verified: $subtopic"
  else
    echo "✗ Missing: $subtopic"
  fi
done

# Use simpler approach:
echo "Verifying reports in: $RESEARCH_SUBDIR"
ls -lh "$RESEARCH_SUBDIR"/*.md || echo "No reports found"

# Count reports
REPORT_COUNT=$(ls -1 "$RESEARCH_SUBDIR"/*.md 2>/dev/null | wc -l)
EXPECTED_COUNT=${#SUBTOPICS[@]}

if [ "$REPORT_COUNT" -eq "$EXPECTED_COUNT" ]; then
  echo "✓ All $EXPECTED_COUNT reports verified"
else
  echo "⚠ Warning: Found $REPORT_COUNT reports, expected $EXPECTED_COUNT"
fi
```

**Impact**:
- Eliminates verification failures
- Maintains same validation logic
- Simpler code (easier to maintain)

**Effort**: Low (1 hour to simplify verification)

### Summary of Critical Fixes

| Issue | Severity | Effort | Lines Changed | Impact |
|-------|----------|--------|---------------|--------|
| Directory detection bash eval error | Critical | 1-2h | -93, +35 (net -58) | 100% reliability |
| Synthesizer output ignored | High | 1-2h | +40 | 99% context reduction |
| Verification bash failures | Medium | 1h | -40, +15 (net -25) | Cleaner execution |
| **Total** | - | **3-5h** | **Net -43 lines** | **Production-ready** |

All three fixes follow the same pattern: **simplify bash commands** to avoid eval escaping issues. The /supervise command demonstrates the working approach—follow that pattern.

## Common Themes Across Reports

### Pattern Recognition Excellence
All three reports identify the `/research` command's **path pre-calculation pattern** as a critical architectural strength. Report 001 documents it as "mandatory path calculation BEFORE agent invocation" (lines 118-154), Report 002 confirms it as Standards-compliant best practice (command-development-guide.md lines 946-1031), and Report 003 validates it as "already optimized, no changes needed" (line 24). This pattern enables parallel agent execution, prevents path mismatch errors, and serves as a reusable template for other orchestration commands.

### Standards Compliance Gaps Are Systematic
The three reports converge on **four critical compliance gaps** that follow a clear pattern:

1. **Execution Enforcement (Standard 0)**: Descriptive language ("I'll orchestrate") instead of imperative directives ("YOU MUST orchestrate")
2. **Verification Checkpoints (Standard 0.5)**: Basic file checks exist but lack "MANDATORY VERIFICATION" markers and guaranteed fallback creation
3. **Behavioral Duplication (Standard 12)**: STEP sequences inline in command prompts instead of referenced from agent behavioral files
4. **Context Management**: No metadata extraction after agent completion despite library availability

These gaps share a root cause: **insufficient enforcement mechanisms**. The command has correct logic but lacks the imperative language, mandatory verification blocks, and fallback guarantees required by command architecture standards.

### Performance vs Reliability Trade-off
Reports identify a subtle tension between **current performance achievements** and **potential reliability improvements**:

- **Current State**: 40-60% time savings, 95% context reduction potential, ~80% file creation rate
- **Optimized State**: Same performance metrics PLUS 100% file creation reliability with only 8-11 hours effort

The trade-off is not performance vs reliability—it's **45 added lines** (verification + fallback mechanisms) vs **absolute execution certainty**. All three reports recommend prioritizing reliability enhancements, as the marginal token cost (1-2%) is trivial compared to preventing workflow failures.

### Library Integration as Scalability Lever
Report 001 documents extensive library usage (unified-location-detection.sh, topic-decomposition.sh, artifact-creation.sh), Report 002 validates these against standards, and Report 003 identifies **two critical unused libraries**:

1. **metadata-extraction.sh**: 95% context reduction (5,000 → 250 tokens per report)
2. **context-pruning.sh**: Aggressive cleanup of completed phase data

The pattern is clear: **libraries are 85% faster and use 0 tokens vs agent-based approaches**, but adoption requires explicit integration work. The `/research` command uses 3 of 5 available libraries—adding the missing 2 would enable scalability from 4 subtopics to 10+ subtopics without context window overflow.

## Key Findings by Category

### Current Implementation Strengths

**Architectural Foundation** (Report 001, lines 16-27):
- **6-step orchestration pattern**: Topic decomposition → Path pre-calculation → Parallel agent invocation → Report verification → Overview synthesis → Cross-reference updates
- **Hierarchical multi-agent design**: 3 specialized agents (research-specialist, research-synthesizer, spec-updater) with clear separation of concerns
- **Path pre-calculation**: All file paths calculated in orchestrator before agent invocation, enabling parallel execution
- **Lazy directory creation**: 80% reduction in mkdir calls, zero empty subdirectories

**Performance Characteristics** (Report 001, lines 95-111):
- **40-60% time savings**: Parallel research vs sequential execution
- **95% context reduction**: Each research-specialist agent focuses on narrow subtopic scope
- **Granular coverage**: 2-4 subtopics per research topic based on word count heuristic
- **Agent timeouts**: 5 minutes per research-specialist, 3 minutes for synthesizer

**Verification and Recovery** (Report 001, lines 137-173):
- **Fallback search mechanism**: Searches research subdirectory by subtopic name pattern if expected path missing
- **Network error handling**: 3 retries with exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s)
- **File access error handling**: 2 retries with 500ms delay
- **Graceful degradation**: Provides partial results with clear limitations

### Standards Compliance Status

**Fully Compliant Areas** (Report 002):
- ✅ **Library Integration Pattern**: Proper use of unified-location-detection.sh (lines 92-107, 85% token reduction)
- ✅ **Path Pre-Calculation**: Follows command-development-guide.md best practices (lines 946-1031)
- ✅ **Phase-Based Tool Usage**: Clear role separation (Delegation Phase: Task+Bash, Verification Phase: Bash+Read)
- ✅ **Agent Invocation Pattern**: Uses Task tool with behavioral file references (not SlashCommand)
- ✅ **Step Numbering**: Sequential dependencies clearly marked (STEP N REQUIRED BEFORE STEP N+1)

**Non-Compliant Areas Requiring Immediate Action** (Report 002, Report 003):
- ❌ **Standard 0 (Execution Enforcement)**: Descriptive language ("I'll") instead of imperative ("YOU MUST"), missing "EXECUTE NOW" markers (Report 003, lines 58-87)
- ❌ **Standard 0.5 (Verification Checkpoints)**: File checks not marked "MANDATORY", no guaranteed fallback creation (Report 003, lines 90-121)
- ❌ **Standard 12 (Behavioral Duplication)**: 48-line agent prompts contain STEP sequences (behavioral content) instead of referencing research-specialist.md (Report 003, lines 123-174)
- ❌ **Context Management Pattern**: No metadata extraction after verification, missing 95% context reduction opportunity (Report 003, lines 33-55)

**Compliance Scoring** (derived from Report 002, lines 560-627):
- Execution Enforcement: 40/100 (needs imperative transformation)
- Verification Checkpoints: 60/100 (checks present but not mandatory)
- Agent Prompt Enforcement: 50/100 (template marked non-modifiable but duplicates behavioral content)
- Context Management: 30/100 (library available but not integrated)
- **Overall Compliance**: 45/100 (needs systematic strengthening)

### Priority Optimization Opportunities

**High Priority (Immediate Action, 8-11 hours total effort):**

1. **Apply Behavioral Injection Pattern** (Report 003, Recommendation 1):
   - **Impact**: 90% code reduction per agent invocation (48 lines → 15 lines), eliminates maintenance burden
   - **Effort**: Low (2-3 hours)
   - **Implementation**: Extract STEP sequences from lines 192-239, replace with behavioral file reference + context injection
   - **Expected Outcome**: -120 lines total, single source of truth for agent behavior, Standard 12 compliance

2. **Add Metadata Extraction Integration** (Report 003, Recommendation 2):
   - **Impact**: 95% context reduction (5,000 → 250 tokens per report), enables <30% context usage
   - **Effort**: Medium (4-5 hours)
   - **Implementation**: Import metadata-extraction.sh, call extract_report_metadata() after Step 4 verification
   - **Expected Outcome**: Context usage 80% → 25%, support 10+ subtopics vs current 4-subtopic limit

3. **Strengthen Verification Checkpoints** (Report 003, Recommendation 3):
   - **Impact**: 100% file creation reliability (up from ~80%), guarantees workflow completion
   - **Effort**: Low (2-3 hours)
   - **Implementation**: Add "MANDATORY VERIFICATION" markers, implement fallback creation, add completion criteria checklist
   - **Expected Outcome**: File creation rate 80% → 100%, automatic error recovery, Standard 0 compliance

**Medium Priority (Near-term, 5-8 hours total effort):**

4. **Add Context Pruning** (Report 003, Recommendation 4):
   - **Impact**: Further context reduction (25% → 20%), memory efficiency
   - **Effort**: Low (1-2 hours)
   - **Details**: Import context-pruning.sh, prune subagent outputs after metadata extraction, prune phase metadata after overview synthesis

5. **Convert to Imperative Language** (Report 003, Recommendation 5):
   - **Impact**: Improved execution reliability, Standard 0 compliance
   - **Effort**: Medium (3-4 hours)
   - **Details**: Replace "I'll" with "YOU MUST", add "EXECUTE NOW" before bash blocks, mark all verification as "MANDATORY"

6. **Add Timeout Recovery** (Report 003, Recommendation 6):
   - **Impact**: Robustness for long-running research tasks, graceful degradation
   - **Effort**: Low (1-2 hours)
   - **Details**: Document timeout recovery procedure, add partial report detection, implement checkpoint-based resume

**Low Priority (Future Consideration, 4-6 hours total effort):**

7. **Template Structure Consolidation** (Report 003, Recommendation 7):
   - **Impact**: 67% reduction in template code (180 → 60 lines)
   - **Effort**: Medium (3-4 hours)
   - **Note**: Structural template consolidation (Standard 12 compliant), not behavioral content duplication

8. **Example Migration to Reference Files** (Report 003, Recommendation 8):
   - **Impact**: 10% command file size reduction (60 lines)
   - **Effort**: Low (1-2 hours)
   - **Details**: Keep 1 core example inline, move additional examples to .claude/docs/reference/research-command-examples.md

## Conflicting Findings or Trade-offs

### Code Reduction vs Reliability Enhancement

**The Tension**: Report 003 identifies both code reduction opportunities (-168 lines, 29%) AND reliability enhancements (+45 lines for verification/fallback). These appear contradictory but are actually complementary:

- **Code Reduction**: Removing behavioral duplication (STEP sequences in prompts) saves 120 lines
- **Code Addition**: Adding verification checkpoints and fallback mechanisms adds 45 lines
- **Net Effect**: -75 lines (13% reduction) with IMPROVED reliability

**Resolution**: All three reports recommend prioritizing reliability over minimal file size. The 45 added lines (1-2% token cost) prevent cascading workflow failures worth 100x the marginal cost.

### Performance Optimization vs Standards Compliance

**The Tension**: Current implementation achieves 40-60% time savings through parallel execution. Would strengthening verification checkpoints and adding fallback mechanisms slow execution?

**Analysis**:
- **Verification checkpoints**: Add ~50-100ms per checkpoint (negligible vs 5-minute agent execution)
- **Fallback creation**: Only triggered on agent failure (~20% of cases), takes ~200ms
- **Metadata extraction**: Adds ~100ms but REDUCES overall time through better context management

**Resolution**: No meaningful performance trade-off. Verification overhead is <1% of total execution time, and metadata extraction actually IMPROVES performance by enabling parallel subtopic scaling (4 → 10+ subtopics).

### Behavioral Injection vs Template Clarity

**The Tension**: Report 003 recommends removing STEP sequences from agent prompts (behavioral content), but Report 001 documents these sequences as critical for agent compliance.

**Clarification**: This is NOT a conflict—it's a misunderstanding of the behavioral injection pattern:

- **Current approach**: STEP sequences duplicated in BOTH research.md (lines 192-239) AND research-specialist.md (lines 73-118)
- **Optimized approach**: STEP sequences ONLY in research-specialist.md, research.md references the behavioral file
- **No loss of clarity**: Agent still receives all STEP instructions (via behavioral file reference), but without duplication

**Resolution**: Report 002 confirms this is Standard 12 compliance requirement (lines 1244-1330). The optimization IMPROVES maintainability without reducing agent instruction clarity.

### Example Inline vs Reference Files

**Minor Tension**: Report 003 Recommendation 8 suggests moving examples to reference files (-60 lines), but Report 002 documents that critical examples must stay inline.

**Clarification**: Standard 1 requires **structural templates** inline (Task syntax, bash blocks, schemas), NOT all examples. Report 003 specifically identifies "supplemental examples" for migration, keeping 1 core example per agent type inline.

**Resolution**: No conflict. Standard 1 (lines 931-943) permits moving supplemental educational examples to reference files while keeping execution-critical templates inline.

## Prioritized Recommendations

### High Priority (Immediate Action)

**1. Strengthen Verification Checkpoints and Fallback Mechanisms**
- **Why First**: Prevents workflow failures (80% → 100% reliability) with minimal effort (2-3 hours)
- **Impact**: Guarantees file creation even when agents fail, eliminates cascading phase failures
- **Dependencies**: None (can be implemented immediately)
- **Validation**: Run 10 test invocations, verify 10/10 file creation success

**2. Apply Behavioral Injection Pattern**
- **Why Second**: Removes 120 lines of duplication, enables single source of truth for agent behavior
- **Impact**: 21% command file reduction, eliminates synchronization burden between command and agent files
- **Dependencies**: Verify research-specialist.md contains all required STEP sequences (it does, per Report 001 lines 176-199)
- **Validation**: Test delegation rate remains 100%, agent behavior unchanged

**3. Add Metadata Extraction Integration**
- **Why Third**: Enables scalability from 4 to 10+ subtopics without context overflow
- **Impact**: 95% context reduction per report (5,000 → 250 tokens), <30% total context usage
- **Dependencies**: Requires verification checkpoints from Recommendation 1 (must verify reports exist before extracting metadata)
- **Validation**: Run research with 8 subtopics, verify context usage <30%

### Medium Priority (Near-term)

**4. Convert to Imperative Language Throughout**
- **Why**: Standard 0 compliance, eliminates execution ambiguity
- **Impact**: Higher step completion rate, clearer execution directives
- **Effort**: 3-4 hours (systematic review of all critical sections)
- **Target**: Imperative ratio ≥90% (audit with .claude/lib/audit-imperative-language.sh)

**5. Add Context Pruning**
- **Why**: Complements metadata extraction for maximum context efficiency
- **Impact**: 25% → 20% context usage, memory efficiency improvement
- **Effort**: 1-2 hours (library already exists, just import and integrate)

**6. Add Timeout Recovery Procedures**
- **Why**: Graceful degradation for long-running research (currently hard failure on timeout)
- **Impact**: Partial results instead of total failure, checkpoint-based resume capability
- **Effort**: 1-2 hours (document procedure + add partial report detection)

### Low Priority (Future Consideration)

**7. Template Structure Consolidation**
- **Why**: Reduces duplication of common template elements (Task syntax, context injection format)
- **Impact**: 67% reduction in template code (180 → 60 lines), but this is structural optimization, not critical
- **Effort**: 3-4 hours (requires careful preservation of all structural templates)
- **Note**: Only pursue after High Priority items complete

**8. Example Migration to Reference Files**
- **Why**: Educational examples don't need to be inline per Standard 1
- **Impact**: 10% file size reduction (60 lines), minor improvement
- **Effort**: 1-2 hours (straightforward content migration)
- **Note**: Lowest priority, pursue only if other work complete

- Systematic review of all critical sections
- Replace descriptive with imperative language
- Add "EXECUTE NOW" and "CHECKPOINT REQUIREMENT" markers
- Run audit script, verify ≥90% imperative ratio

**Phase 5: Context Pruning + Timeout Recovery (3-4 hours combined)**
- Import context-pruning.sh and integrate
- Document timeout recovery procedures
- Add partial report detection
- Test graceful degradation scenarios

**Validation Criteria** (End of Week 4):
- [ ] Imperative ratio: ≥90%
- [ ] Context usage: <25% (with pruning)
- [ ] Timeout recovery: Partial results instead of failure
- [ ] Full standards compliance: All critical standards met

### Documentation and Knowledge Transfer (Week 5)

1. **Extract path pre-calculation pattern** to .claude/docs/concepts/patterns/path-precalculation.md (per Report 001 Recommendation 1)
2. **Update command development guide** with /research as example of proper behavioral injection
3. **Create migration playbook** for other commands to adopt verification-fallback pattern
4. **Performance benchmark results** in .claude/data/logs/research-performance.log
