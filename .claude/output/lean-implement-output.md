● Now I'll invoke the lean-coordinator via the Task tool
   for wave-based theorem proving orchestration:

● Task(Wave-based full plan theorem proving orchestration)
  ⎿  Done (18 tool uses · 73.9k tokens · 2m 51s)       

● The lean-coordinator analyzed the plan and determined
  sequential execution is optimal due to phase
  dependencies. Let me verify the summary was created:

      set +o histexpand 2>/dev/null || true…)
  ⎿  === Hard Barrier Verification ===
     … +79 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

● The summary exists and shows that the lean-coordinator
   deferred execution to lean-implementer due to context
   efficiency. The coordinator recommends sequential
  execution. I need to invoke lean-implementer directly
  to actually perform the theorem proving work:

● Task(Sequential theorem proving for phases 1-4)
  ⎿  Done (34 tool uses · 0 tokens · 6m 19s)
