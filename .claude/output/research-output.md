● The bash array substitution syntax has issues. Let me
  fix this and proceed:

● Now let me first read the plan file to understand what
   Phase 1 involves:

● Read(.claude/specs/065_proof_automation_temporal_deduction
      /plans/001-proof-automation-completion-plan.md)
  ⎿  Read 487 lines

● Now I have a clear understanding of Phase 1. Let me
  also read the current state of the
  DeductionTheorem.lean file to understand the exact
  sorry markers:

● Read(Logos/Core/Metalogic/DeductionTheorem.lean)
  ⎿  Read 441 lines

● Now I have a complete understanding of Phase 1. Let me
   conduct systematic online research for the theorems
  and techniques needed. I'll invoke the research
  coordinator:
