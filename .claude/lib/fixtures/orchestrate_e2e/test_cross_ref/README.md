# Cross-Reference Test Fixtures

Test fixtures for plan cross-reference and dependency linking validation.

## Purpose

This directory contains plan fixtures with cross-referenced phases and dependencies used to verify that orchestration systems correctly resolve phase relationships and maintain referential integrity during plan parsing and execution.

**Structure**: Multiple phases with inter-phase dependencies

### phase_1_setup.md
**Purpose**: Expanded phase file with dependency references
**Test Coverage**: Phase-level cross-reference parsing
**Structure**: Phase fragment with dependency declarations
