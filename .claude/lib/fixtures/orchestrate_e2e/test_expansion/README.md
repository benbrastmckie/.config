# Expansion Test Fixtures

Test fixtures for plan expansion and progressive disclosure validation.

## Purpose

This directory contains plan fixtures used to verify the plan expansion system that progressively expands plans from Level 0 (inline) to Level 1 (phase files) to Level 2 (stage files). Tests ensure expansion creates correct file structure and preserves plan semantics.

## Files in This Directory

### test_expansion.md
**Purpose**: Compact plan for expansion testing
**Test Coverage**: Progressive plan expansion tests (L0 → L1 → L2)
**Structure**: Minimal structure suitable for expansion validation
