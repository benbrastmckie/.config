# Auto-Analysis Test Data

Test data for automatic plan analysis and complexity scoring.

## Purpose

This directory contains test plan data used to verify automatic analysis features including complexity scoring, time estimation, and structural analysis. Tests ensure analysis algorithms produce consistent and accurate results.

## Files in This Directory

### test_plan.md
**Purpose**: Sample plan for analysis testing
**Test Coverage**: Complexity scoring, time estimation, structural analysis
**Structure**: Representative plan with varied task types and dependencies
