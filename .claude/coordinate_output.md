> /coordinate is running… once all plans in a given specs/NNN_topic/ directory have been fully 
implemented, I want the final stage of the implementation phase in /coordinate to archive the 
NNN_topic/ directory by moving it to specs/archive/ which should be .gitignored to reduce clutter. If 
there are plans in that topic directory that are not fully complete, this step can be skipped with a 
note to the user. research, plan, and implement this minor refactor while conforming to the standards 
given in .claude/docs/

● I'll help you implement topic directory archiving in the /coordinate command. Let me break this
  down into phases: research, planning, and implementation.

● Let me start by researching the current implementation structure and relevant patterns.
