> /coordinate is running… when running the /research command, there are still fallbacks and the old 
style of reporting as seen below:
  - ● Bash(# MANDATORY VERIFICATION with fallback creation
        SUBTOPICS=(…)
    ⎿  Verifying report 1/3: ✓ (21KB)
       Verifying report 2/3: ✓ (23KB)

● I'll help you research and fix the issue with the /research command still using fallbacks and
  old-style reporting. Let me start by creating a todo list to track this work.

● Now let me research the /research command to understand the current implementation and identify
  the fallback patterns.

● Read(.claude/commands/research.md)
  ⎿  Read 990 lines

● Now I can see the issue clearly. The /research command has fallback mechanisms in STEP 4 (lines
  344-429) that create placeholder reports when agents fail. This is exactly what needs to be
  removed based on the fail-fast philosophy used in /coordinate. Let me check the verification
  helper function pattern from /coordinate:

● Bash(grep -A 30 "verify_file_created" /home/benjamin/.config/.claude/commands/coordinate.md | head
      -40)
  ⎿  # verify_file_created - Concise file verification with optional verbose failure
     #
     # Arguments:
     … +38 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

● Good! Now let me create a comprehensive research report and implementation plan to fix this
  issue.

● Now let me invoke the /coordinate command to research this issue and create an implementation
  plan:
