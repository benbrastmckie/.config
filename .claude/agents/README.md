# Agents Directory

Specialized AI agent definitions for Claude Code. Each agent is a focused assistant with specific capabilities, tool access, and expertise designed to handle particular aspects of development workflows.

**Current Agent Count**: 22 specialized agents + 1 documentation file

## Recent Changes

### Registry Update (2025-10-27)
Added 5 missing agents to registry for complete tracking:

**Agents Added to Registry**:
- `doc-converter-usage.md` → Documentation file (not an agent, to be moved in Phase 2)
- `git-commit-helper.md` → Specialized (to be refactored to library in Phase 5)
- `implementation-executor.md` → Hierarchical implementation agent
- `implementer-coordinator.md` → Hierarchical coordinator agent
- `research-synthesizer.md` → Specialized research agent

**Impact**:
- Registry: 17 → 22 entries (100% coverage)
- Agent discovery improved
- Metrics tracking enabled for all agents

### Agent Cleanup (2025-10-26)
Removed deprecated agent to improve maintainability:

**Agent Removed**:
- `location-specialist.md` → **Archived** (superseded by unified location detection library)

**Impact**:
- Agents: 22 → 21 files (4.5% reduction, ~14KB saved)
- Functionality preserved in `.claude/lib/unified-location-detection.sh`
- Unified codebase with library-based location detection

## Agent Invocation

Agents are typically invoked by commands, not directly by users.

### From Commands
```markdown
I'll invoke the code-writer agent to implement this feature.

[Invoke code-writer with context]
```

### Context Passing
When invoking an agent, provide:
- **Task description**: What needs to be done
- **Relevant files**: Files the agent should focus on
- **Standards**: CLAUDE.md sections to follow
- **Constraints**: Any limitations or requirements

## Best Practices

### Agent Design
- **Single responsibility**: Each agent has one clear purpose
- **Minimal tool access**: Only tools necessary for the agent's role
- **Clear instructions**: Detailed capability descriptions
- **Standards awareness**: Reference CLAUDE.md sections

### Tool Selection
- **Read-only when possible**: Prefer analysis over modification
- **Bash for verification**: Allow running tests or checks
- **TodoWrite for tracking**: Enable progress visibility in multi-step tasks

### Error Handling
- **Graceful degradation**: Handle missing tools or files
- **Clear reporting**: Explain what was done and what failed
- **Non-blocking**: Don't halt workflows on non-critical failures

## Creating Custom Agents

### Step 1: Define Purpose
Identify the specific task or domain the agent will handle.

### Step 2: Determine Tools
Choose minimal tools needed for the agent's responsibilities.

### Step 3: Write Definition
Create agent markdown file with metadata and instructions.

```bash
# Create new agent
nvim .claude/agents/your-agent.md
```

### Step 4: Document Capabilities
Clearly describe what the agent can and cannot do.

### Step 5: Test
Invoke the agent from a command and verify behavior.

## Agent Communication

### Input
Agents receive:
- **Task context**: Description of what to do
- **File paths**: Relevant files to work with
- **Standards**: CLAUDE.md sections to follow
- **State**: Current project state

### Output
Agents provide:
- **Completion status**: Success or failure
- **Results**: What was created or found
- **Next steps**: Recommendations for follow-up
- **Issues**: Problems encountered

## Integration with Commands

Commands orchestrate agents to accomplish complex workflows:

```
/implement
  ├── plan-architect → Design phases
  ├── code-writer → Implement each phase
  ├── test-specialist → Verify implementation
  └── doc-writer → Update documentation

/report
  ├── research-specialist → Gather information
  └── doc-writer → Format report

/debug
  ├── debug-specialist → Investigate issue
  └── code-writer → Apply fixes (if requested)

/expand-phase (agent-assisted for complex phases)
  └── general-purpose + research-specialist behavior → Research phase context
```

### /expand-phase Integration

**Agent Usage Pattern**: Behavioral Injection

`/expand-phase` uses a unique pattern: **general-purpose agents** with **behavioral guidelines** from agent definition files.

**Why**: Claude Code only supports 3 agent types (general-purpose, statusline-setup, output-style-setup). We simulate specialized agents by having general-purpose agents read and follow behavior definitions.

**Invocation**:
```markdown
Task tool:
  subagent_type: general-purpose  # Only valid type
  prompt: |
    Read and follow: .claude/agents/research-specialist.md

    [Agent-specific instructions]
```

**Agent Behaviors Used**:
- **research-specialist**: Default for codebase analysis (complex phases)
- **code-reviewer**: For refactor/consolidation phases
- **plan-architect**: For very complex phase structure analysis

**Complexity Detection**:
- Simple phases (≤5 tasks, <10 files): Direct expansion, no agent
- Complex phases (>5 tasks, ≥10 files, or keywords): Agent-assisted research

**Synthesis**:
Agent provides 200-250 word research → Claude synthesizes into 300-500+ line detailed specification

**Benefits**:
- Real file:line references from research
- Concrete code examples based on patterns found
- Testing strategy based on current codebase state
- Implementation steps use actual structures

See `.claude/commands/expand-phase.md` for detailed agent usage patterns.

## Neovim Integration

Agents in this directory are integrated with the Neovim artifact picker, appearing in two contexts:

### Picker Display Modes

1. **Nested Under Commands** - Agents appear indented under commands that use them
   ```
   * plan                        Create implementation plans
     ├─ [agent] plan-architect  AI planning specialist
     └─ list-reports            List available research reports
   ```

2. **Standalone Agents Section** - Agents not associated with any command appear in a dedicated [Agents] category

### Accessing Agents via Picker

- **Keybinding**: `<leader>ac` in normal mode
- **Command**: `:ClaudeCommands`
- **Category**: [Agents] section (for standalone) or nested under commands

### Picker Features for Agents

**Visual Display**:
- Agent names prefixed with `[agent]` tag
- Local agents marked with `*` prefix
- Nested under parent commands with tree characters
- Cross-references showing which commands use each agent

**Preview Features**:
- Agent description and capabilities
- Allowed tools list
- "Commands that use this agent" section with tree-formatted list
- File location and local/global status

**Quick Actions**:
- `<CR>` - Open agent file for editing
- `<C-l>` - Load agent locally to project
- `<C-g>` - Update from global version
- `<C-s>` - Save local agent to global
- `<C-e>` - Edit agent file in buffer
- `<C-u>`/`<C-d>` - Scroll preview up/down

**Example Workflow**:
```vim
" Open picker
:ClaudeCommands

" Navigate to plan-architect agent
" Preview shows: "Commands that use this agent: ├─ plan, └─ revise"
" Press <C-e> to edit agent definition
```

### Agent Cross-References

The picker automatically displays which commands use each agent in the preview pane:

```
Agent: plan-architect

Description: AI planning specialist

Allowed Tools: ReadFile, WriteFile, SlashCommand

Commands that use this agent:
   ├─ plan
   └─ revise

File: /home/user/.claude/agents/plan-architect.md
```

This helps discover agent usage patterns and identify agents suitable for reuse in new commands.
