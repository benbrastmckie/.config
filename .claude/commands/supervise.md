# /supervise - Clean Multi-Agent Workflow Orchestration

## YOUR ROLE: WORKFLOW ORCHESTRATOR

**YOU ARE THE ORCHESTRATOR** for this multi-agent workflow.

**YOUR RESPONSIBILITIES**:
1. Pre-calculate ALL artifact paths before any agent invocations
2. Determine workflow scope (research-only, research-and-plan, full-implementation, debug-only)
3. Invoke specialized agents via Task tool with complete context injection
4. Verify agent outputs at mandatory checkpoints
5. Extract and aggregate metadata from agent results (forward message pattern)
6. Report final workflow status and artifact locations

**YOU MUST NEVER**:
1. Execute tasks yourself using Read/Grep/Write/Edit tools
2. Invoke other commands via SlashCommand tool (/plan, /implement, /debug, /document)
3. Modify or create files directly (except in Phase 0 setup)
4. Skip mandatory verification checkpoints
5. Continue workflow after verification failure

**ARCHITECTURAL PATTERN**:
- Phase 0: Pre-calculate paths → Create topic directory structure
- Phase 1-N: Invoke agents with pre-calculated paths → Verify → Extract metadata
- Completion: Report success + artifact locations

**TOOLS ALLOWED**:
- Task: ONLY tool for agent invocations
- TodoWrite: Track phase progress
- Bash: Verification checkpoints (ls, grep, wc)
- Read: Parse agent output files for metadata extraction (not for task execution)

**TOOLS PROHIBITED**:
- SlashCommand: NEVER invoke /plan, /implement, /debug, or any command
- Write/Edit: NEVER create artifact files (agents do this)
- Grep/Glob: NEVER search codebase directly (agents do this)

## Architectural Prohibition: No Command Chaining

**CRITICAL PROHIBITION**: This command MUST NEVER invoke other commands via the SlashCommand tool.

### Why This Matters

**Wrong Pattern - Command Chaining** (causes context bloat and broken behavioral injection):
```yaml
# ❌ INCORRECT - Do NOT do this
SlashCommand {
  command: "/plan create auth feature"
}
```

**Problems with command chaining**:
1. **Context Bloat**: Entire /plan command prompt injected into your context (~2000 lines)
2. **Broken Behavioral Injection**: /plan's behavior not customizable via prompt
3. **Lost Control**: Cannot inject specific instructions or constraints
4. **No Metadata**: Get full output, not structured data for aggregation

**Correct Pattern - Direct Agent Invocation** (lean context, behavioral control):

<!-- This Task invocation is executable -->
# ✅ CORRECT - Do this instead
Task {
  subagent_type: "general-purpose"
  description: "Create implementation plan"
  prompt: "
    Read and follow ALL behavioral guidelines from: .claude/agents/plan-architect.md

    **Workflow-Specific Context**:
    - Plan Path: ${PLAN_PATH} (absolute path, pre-calculated)
    - Research Reports: [list of paths]
    - Project Standards: [path to CLAUDE.md]

    Execute planning following all guidelines in behavioral file.
    Return: PLAN_CREATED: ${PLAN_PATH}
  "
}

**Benefits of direct agent invocation**:
1. **Lean Context**: Only agent behavioral guidelines loaded (~200 lines)
2. **Behavioral Control**: Can inject custom instructions, constraints, templates
3. **Structured Output**: Agent returns metadata (path, status) not full summaries
4. **Verification Points**: Can verify file creation before continuing

### Side-by-Side Comparison

| Aspect | Command Chaining (❌) | Direct Agent Invocation (✅) |
|--------|---------------------|------------------------------|
| Context Usage | ~2000 lines (full command) | ~200 lines (agent guidelines) |
| Behavioral Control | Fixed (command prompt) | Flexible (custom instructions) |
| Output Format | Full text summaries | Structured metadata |
| Verification | None (black box) | Explicit checkpoints |
| Path Control | Agent calculates | Orchestrator pre-calculates |
| Role Separation | Blurred (orchestrator executes) | Clear (orchestrator delegates) |

### Enforcement

If you find yourself wanting to invoke /plan, /implement, /debug, or /document:

1. **STOP** - You are about to violate the architectural pattern
2. **IDENTIFY** - What task does that command perform?
3. **DELEGATE** - Invoke the appropriate agent directly via Task tool
4. **INJECT** - Provide the agent with behavioral guidelines and context
5. **VERIFY** - Check that the agent created the expected artifacts

**REMEMBER**: You are the **ORCHESTRATOR**, not the **EXECUTOR**. Delegate work to agents.

## Workflow Overview

**DOCUMENTATION**: For complete usage guide, see [/supervise Usage Guide](../docs/guides/supervise-guide.md)

**PHASE REFERENCE**: For detailed phase documentation, see [/supervise Phase Reference](../docs/reference/supervise-phases.md)

This command coordinates multi-agent workflows through 7 phases:

```
Phase 0: Location and Path Pre-Calculation
  ↓
Phase 1: Research (2-4 parallel agents)
  ↓
Phase 2: Planning (conditional)
  ↓
Phase 3: Implementation (conditional)
  ↓
Phase 4: Testing (conditional)
  ↓
Phase 5: Debug (conditional - only if tests fail)
  ↓
Phase 6: Documentation (conditional - only if implementation occurred)
```

### Workflow Scope Types

The command detects the workflow type and executes only the appropriate phases:

1. **research-only**: Phases 0-1 only
   - Keywords: "research [topic]" without "plan" or "implement"
   - Use case: Pure exploratory research
   - No plan created, no summary

2. **research-and-plan**: Phases 0-2 only (MOST COMMON)
   - Keywords: "research...to create plan", "analyze...for planning"
   - Use case: Research to inform planning
   - Creates research reports + implementation plan
   - No summary (no implementation)

3. **full-implementation**: Phases 0-4, 6
   - Keywords: "implement", "build", "add feature"
   - Use case: Complete feature development
   - Phase 5 conditional on test failures
   - Creates all artifacts including summary

4. **debug-only**: Phases 0, 1, 5 only
   - Keywords: "fix [bug]", "debug [issue]", "troubleshoot [error]"
   - Use case: Bug fixing without new implementation
   - No new plan or summary

### Performance Targets

- **Context Usage**: <25% throughout workflow
- **File Creation Rate**: 100% with auto-recovery (single retry for transient failures)
- **Recovery Rate**: >95% for transient errors (timeouts, file locks)
- **Performance Overhead**: <5% for recovery infrastructure
- **Enhanced Error Reporting**:
  - Error location extraction accuracy: >90%
  - Error type categorization accuracy: >85%
  - Error reporting overhead: <30ms per error (negligible)

## Auto-Recovery

This command implements verification-fallback pattern with single-retry for transient errors.

**Key Behaviors**:
- Transient errors (timeouts, file locks): Single retry after 1s delay
- Permanent errors (syntax, dependencies): Fail-fast with diagnostics
- Partial research failure: Continue if ≥50% agents succeed

**See**: [Verification-Fallback Pattern](../docs/concepts/patterns/verification-fallback.md)
**See**: [Error Handling Library](../lib/error-handling.sh) - Implementation details

## Enhanced Error Reporting

Failed operations receive enhanced diagnostics via error-handling.sh:
- Error location extraction (file:line parsing)
- Error type categorization (timeout, syntax, dependency, unknown)
- Context-specific recovery suggestions

**See**: [Error Handling Library](../lib/error-handling.sh) - Complete error reporting implementation

## Partial Failure Handling

Research phase (Phase 1) continues if ≥50% of parallel agents succeed. Workflow logs failures and continues with partial results.

## Fail-Fast Error Handling

**Design Philosophy**: All library dependencies are required - no fallback mechanisms.

**Required Libraries** (hard exit on missing):
- workflow-detection.sh - Workflow scope detection and phase execution control
- error-handling.sh - Error classification and recovery
- checkpoint-utils.sh - Workflow resume capability
- unified-logger.sh - Progress tracking
- unified-location-detection.sh - Project structure location detection
- metadata-extraction.sh - Artifact metadata extraction
- context-pruning.sh - Context management

**Rationale**: Fallback mechanisms hide configuration errors and make debugging harder. Explicit errors force proper setup and enable consistent behavior across environments.

**Error Handling**:
- Clear, actionable error messages showing which library failed
- Diagnostic commands included in error output
- Function-to-library mapping shown when functions missing
- Immediate exit (no silent degradation)

## Checkpoint Resume

Checkpoints saved after Phases 1-4. Auto-resumes from last completed phase on startup.

**Behavior**: Validates checkpoint → Skips completed phases → Resumes seamlessly

**See**: [Checkpoint Recovery Pattern](../docs/concepts/patterns/checkpoint-recovery.md) - Schema and implementation details

## Progress Markers

Emit silent progress markers at phase boundaries:
```
PROGRESS: [Phase N] - [action]
```

Example: `PROGRESS: [Phase 1] - Research complete (4/4 succeeded)`

**Verification**: All required functions available via sourced libraries.

**Note on Design Decisions** (Phase 1B):
- **Metadata extraction** not implemented: supervise uses path-based context passing (not full content), so the 95% context reduction claim doesn't apply
- **Context pruning** not implemented: bash variables naturally scope, no evidence of context bloat in current architecture
- **retry_with_backoff** implemented: 6 verification points wrapped for resilience against transient failures (ZERO overhead in success case)

## Phase 0: Project Location and Path Pre-Calculation

[EXECUTION-CRITICAL: Path calculation before agent invocations - inline bash required]

**Objective**: Establish topic directory structure and calculate all artifact paths.

**Pattern**: utility-based location detection → directory creation → path export

**Optimization**: Uses deterministic bash utilities (topic-utils.sh, detect-project-dir.sh) for 85-95% token reduction and 20x+ speedup compared to agent-based detection.

**Critical**: ALL paths MUST be calculated before Phase 1 begins.

### Implementation

STEP 1: Parse workflow description from command arguments

```bash
WORKFLOW_DESCRIPTION="$1"

if [ -z "$WORKFLOW_DESCRIPTION" ]; then
  echo "━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━"
  echo "DIAGNOSTIC INFO: Missing Workflow Description"
  echo "━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━"
  echo ""
  echo "ERROR: Workflow description required"
  echo ""
  echo "Usage: /supervise \"<workflow description>\""
  echo ""
  echo "Examples:"
  echo "  /supervise \"research API authentication patterns\""
  echo "  /supervise \"plan user profile feature\""
  echo "  /supervise \"implement and test authentication system\""
  echo "  /supervise \"debug login failure issue\""
  echo ""
  exit 1
fi

# Check for existing checkpoint (auto-resume capability)
RESUME_DATA=$(restore_checkpoint "supervise" 2>/dev/null || echo "")
if [ -n "$RESUME_DATA" ]; then
  RESUME_PHASE=$(echo "$RESUME_DATA" | jq -r '.current_phase // empty')
else
  RESUME_PHASE=""
fi

if [ -n "$RESUME_PHASE" ]; then
  echo "════════════════════════════════════════════════════════"
  echo "  CHECKPOINT DETECTED - RESUMING WORKFLOW"
  echo "════════════════════════════════════════════════════════"
  echo ""
  emit_progress "Resume" "Skipping completed phases 0-$((RESUME_PHASE - 1))"
  echo ""
  echo "Resuming from Phase $RESUME_PHASE..."
  echo ""

  # Skip to the resume phase
  # (Implementation note: In actual execution, this would jump to the appropriate phase section)
fi
```

STEP 2: Detect workflow scope

```bash
WORKFLOW_SCOPE=$(detect_workflow_scope "$WORKFLOW_DESCRIPTION")

# Map scope to phase execution list
case "$WORKFLOW_SCOPE" in
  research-only)
    PHASES_TO_EXECUTE="0,1"
    SKIP_PHASES="2,3,4,5,6"
    ;;
  research-and-plan)
    PHASES_TO_EXECUTE="0,1,2"
    SKIP_PHASES="3,4,5,6"
    ;;
  full-implementation)
    PHASES_TO_EXECUTE="0,1,2,3,4"
    SKIP_PHASES=""  # Phase 5 conditional on test failures, Phase 6 always
    ;;
  debug-only)
    PHASES_TO_EXECUTE="0,1,5"
    SKIP_PHASES="2,3,4,6"
    ;;
esac

export WORKFLOW_SCOPE PHASES_TO_EXECUTE SKIP_PHASES

echo "━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━"
echo "Workflow Scope Detection"
echo "━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━"
echo ""
echo "Description: \"$WORKFLOW_DESCRIPTION\""
echo "Detected Scope: $WORKFLOW_SCOPE"
echo ""
echo "Phase Execution Plan:"
echo "  Execute: Phases $PHASES_TO_EXECUTE"
if [ -n "$SKIP_PHASES" ]; then
  echo "  Skip: Phases $SKIP_PHASES"
fi
echo ""
echo "Scope Behavior:"
case "$WORKFLOW_SCOPE" in
  research-only)
    echo "  - Research topic in parallel (2-4 agents)"
    echo "  - Create overview document"
    echo "  - Exit after Phase 1"
    ;;
  research-and-plan)
    echo "  - Research topic in parallel (2-4 agents)"
    echo "  - Generate implementation plan"
    echo "  - Exit after Phase 2"
    ;;
  full-implementation)
    echo "  - Research → Plan → Implement → Test → Document"
    echo "  - Full end-to-end workflow"
    ;;
  debug-only)
    echo "  - Research root cause"
    echo "  - Generate debug report"
    echo "  - Exit after Phase 5"
    ;;
esac
echo ""
```

STEP 3: Initialize workflow paths using consolidated function

Use the workflow-initialization.sh library for unified path calculation and directory creation.

```bash
# Source workflow initialization library
SCRIPT_DIR="$(cd "$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")" && pwd)"

if [ -f "$SCRIPT_DIR/../lib/workflow-initialization.sh" ]; then
  source "$SCRIPT_DIR/../lib/workflow-initialization.sh"
else
  echo "ERROR: workflow-initialization.sh not found"
  echo "This is a required library file for workflow operation."
  echo "Please ensure .claude/lib/workflow-initialization.sh exists."
  exit 1
fi

# Call unified initialization function
# This consolidates STEPS 3-7 (225+ lines → ~10 lines)
# Implements 3-step pattern: scope detection → path pre-calculation → directory creation
if ! initialize_workflow_paths "$WORKFLOW_DESCRIPTION" "$WORKFLOW_SCOPE"; then
  echo "ERROR: Workflow initialization failed"
  exit 1
fi

# Reconstruct REPORT_PATHS array from exported variables
# (Bash arrays cannot be directly exported, so we use a helper function)
reconstruct_report_paths_array
```

## Phase 1: Research

[EXECUTION-CRITICAL: Agent invocation patterns and verification - templates must be inline]

**Objective**: Conduct parallel research on workflow topics with 100% file creation rate.

**Pattern**: Analyze complexity → Invoke 2-4 research agents in parallel → Verify all files created → Extract metadata

**Critical Success Factor**: 100% file creation rate on first attempt (no retries)

### Phase 1 Execution Check

```bash
should_run_phase 1 || {
  echo "⏭️  Skipping Phase 1 (Research)"
  echo "  Reason: Workflow type is $WORKFLOW_SCOPE"
  echo ""
  display_brief_summary
  exit 0
}
```

### Complexity-Based Research Topics

STEP 1: Determine research complexity (1-4 topics based on workflow)

```bash
# Simple keyword-based complexity scoring
RESEARCH_COMPLEXITY=2  # Default: 2 research topics

# Increase complexity for these keywords
if echo "$WORKFLOW_DESCRIPTION" | grep -Eiq "integrate|migration|refactor|architecture"; then
  RESEARCH_COMPLEXITY=3
fi

# Increase further for very complex workflows
if echo "$WORKFLOW_DESCRIPTION" | grep -Eiq "multi-.*system|cross-.*platform|distributed|microservices"; then
  RESEARCH_COMPLEXITY=4
fi

# Reduce for simple workflows
if echo "$WORKFLOW_DESCRIPTION" | grep -Eiq "^(fix|update|modify).*(one|single|small)"; then
  RESEARCH_COMPLEXITY=1
fi

echo "Research Complexity Score: $RESEARCH_COMPLEXITY topics"
echo ""
```

### Parallel Research Agent Invocation

STEP 2: Invoke 2-4 research agents in parallel (single message, multiple Task calls)

**CRITICAL**: All agents invoked in a single message for parallel execution.

```bash
# Emit progress marker before agent invocations
emit_progress "1" "Invoking $RESEARCH_COMPLEXITY research agents in parallel"
echo ""
```

**EXECUTE NOW**: USE the Task tool for each research topic (1 to $RESEARCH_COMPLEXITY) with these parameters:

- subagent_type: "general-purpose"
- description: "Research [insert topic name] with mandatory file creation"
- prompt: |
    Read and follow ALL behavioral guidelines from: .claude/agents/research-specialist.md

    **Workflow-Specific Context**:
    - Research Topic: [insert workflow description for this topic]
    - Report Path: [insert absolute path from REPORT_PATHS array]
    - Project Standards: /home/benjamin/.config/CLAUDE.md
    - Complexity Level: $RESEARCH_COMPLEXITY

    **CRITICAL**: Before writing report file, ensure parent directory exists:
    Use Bash tool: mkdir -p "$(dirname "[insert report path]")"

    Execute research following all guidelines in behavioral file.
    Return: REPORT_CREATED: [insert exact absolute path]

```bash
# Emit progress marker after agent invocations complete
emit_progress "1" "All research agents invoked - awaiting completion"
echo ""
```

### Mandatory Verification - Research Reports with Auto-Recovery

**VERIFICATION REQUIRED**: All research report files must exist before continuing to Phase 2

STEP 3: Verify ALL research reports created successfully (with single-retry for transient failures)

```bash
echo "════════════════════════════════════════════════════════"
echo "  MANDATORY VERIFICATION - Research Reports"
echo "════════════════════════════════════════════════════════"
echo ""

VERIFICATION_FAILURES=0
SUCCESSFUL_REPORT_PATHS=()
FAILED_AGENTS=()

for i in $(seq 1 $RESEARCH_COMPLEXITY); do
  REPORT_PATH="${REPORT_PATHS[$i-1]}"

  # Emit progress marker
  emit_progress "1" "Verifying research report $i/$RESEARCH_COMPLEXITY"

  echo "Verifying Report $i: $(basename $REPORT_PATH)"

  # Check if file exists and has content (with retry for transient failures)
  if retry_with_backoff 2 1000 test -f "$REPORT_PATH" -a -s "$REPORT_PATH"; then
    # Success path - perform quality checks
    FILE_SIZE=$(wc -c < "$REPORT_PATH")

    if [ "$FILE_SIZE" -lt 200 ]; then
      echo "  ⚠️  WARNING: File is very small ($FILE_SIZE bytes)"
    fi

    if ! grep -q "^# " "$REPORT_PATH"; then
      echo "  ⚠️  WARNING: Missing markdown header"
    fi

    echo "  ✅ PASSED: Report created successfully ($FILE_SIZE bytes)"
    SUCCESSFUL_REPORT_PATHS+=("$REPORT_PATH")
  else
    # Failure path - extract error info and attempt recovery
    ERROR_MSG="Report file missing or empty: $REPORT_PATH"
    ERROR_LOCATION=$(extract_error_location "$ERROR_MSG")
    ERROR_TYPE=$(detect_specific_error_type "$ERROR_MSG")

    # Classify error for retry decision
    RETRY_DECISION=$(classify_and_retry "$ERROR_MSG")

    if [ "$RETRY_DECISION" == "retry" ]; then
      echo "  ⚠️  TRANSIENT ERROR: Retrying once..."

      # Note: In actual execution, retry would re-invoke the agent
      # For now, just re-check the file after a short delay
      sleep 1

      if retry_with_backoff 2 1000 test -f "$REPORT_PATH" -a -s "$REPORT_PATH"; then
        FILE_SIZE=$(wc -c < "$REPORT_PATH")
        echo "  ✅ RETRY SUCCESSFUL: Report created ($FILE_SIZE bytes)"
        SUCCESSFUL_REPORT_PATHS+=("$REPORT_PATH")
      else
        # Retry failed - update error info and mark as failed
        ERROR_TYPE=$(detect_specific_error_type "Retry failed: $ERROR_MSG")
        ERROR_LOCATION=$(extract_error_location "$REPORT_PATH")

        echo "  ❌ RETRY FAILED: Report still missing"
        echo ""
        echo "ERROR: $ERROR_TYPE"
        if [ -n "$ERROR_LOCATION" ]; then
          echo "   at $ERROR_LOCATION"
        fi

### Research Overview (Conditional Synthesis)

STEP 4: Conditionally create overview report based on workflow scope

**DECISION LOGIC**: Overview synthesis only occurs for research-only workflows.
When planning follows (research-and-plan, full-implementation), the plan-architect
agent will synthesize research reports, making OVERVIEW.md redundant.

```bash
# Determine if overview synthesis should occur
# Uses shared library function: should_synthesize_overview()
if should_synthesize_overview "$WORKFLOW_SCOPE" "$SUCCESSFUL_REPORT_COUNT"; then
  # Calculate overview path using standardized function (ALL CAPS format)
  OVERVIEW_PATH=$(calculate_overview_path "$RESEARCH_SUBDIR")

  echo "Creating research overview to synthesize findings..."
  echo "  Path: $OVERVIEW_PATH"

  # Build report list for overview agent
  REPORT_LIST=""
  for report in "${SUCCESSFUL_REPORT_PATHS[@]}"; do
    REPORT_LIST+="- $report\n"
  done

  # Invoke overview synthesizer agent
  # Task {
  #   subagent_type: "general-purpose"
  #   description: "Synthesize research findings"
  #   prompt: "
  #     Read: .claude/agents/research-specialist.md
  #
  #     STEP 1: Use Write tool to create: $OVERVIEW_PATH
  #     STEP 2: Read all research reports and synthesize:
  #             ${REPORT_LIST}
  #     STEP 3: Write 400-500 word overview with:
  #             - Common themes across reports
  #             - Conflicting findings (if any)
  #             - Prioritized recommendations
  #             - Cross-references between reports
  #     STEP 4: Return ONLY: OVERVIEW_CREATED: $OVERVIEW_PATH
  #   "
  # }

  # Verify overview created
  verify_file_created "$OVERVIEW_PATH" "Research Overview" "$AGENT_OUTPUT"
else
  # Overview synthesis skipped - plan-architect will synthesize reports
  SKIP_REASON=$(get_synthesis_skip_reason "$WORKFLOW_SCOPE" "$SUCCESSFUL_REPORT_COUNT")
  echo "⏭️  Skipping overview synthesis"
  echo "  Reason: $SKIP_REASON"
  echo ""
fi

echo "Phase 1 Complete: Research artifacts verified"
echo ""

# Save checkpoint after Phase 1
ARTIFACT_PATHS_JSON=$(cat <<EOF
{
  "research_reports": [$(printf '"%s",' "${SUCCESSFUL_REPORT_PATHS[@]}" | sed 's/,$//')]
  $([ -n "$OVERVIEW_PATH" ] && [ -f "$OVERVIEW_PATH" ] && echo ', "overview_path": "'$OVERVIEW_PATH'"' || echo '')
}
EOF
)
save_checkpoint "supervise" "phase_1" "$ARTIFACT_PATHS_JSON"
```

## Phase 2: Planning

[EXECUTION-CRITICAL: Agent invocation patterns and verification - templates must be inline]

**Objective**: Create implementation plan using Task tool with behavioral injection (no SlashCommand).

**Pattern**: Prepare context → Invoke plan-architect agent → Verify plan created → Extract metadata

**Critical**: Uses Task tool with behavioral injection, NOT /plan command

### Phase 2 Execution Check

```bash
should_run_phase 2 || {
  echo "⏭️  Skipping Phase 2 (Planning)"
  echo "  Reason: Workflow type is $WORKFLOW_SCOPE"
  echo ""
  display_brief_summary
  exit 0
}
```

### Planning Context Preparation

STEP 1: Prepare planning context with research metadata (95% context reduction)

```bash
echo "Preparing planning context with metadata..."

# Build research metadata list for injection (using extracted metadata)
RESEARCH_METADATA_LIST=""
for report in "${SUCCESSFUL_REPORT_PATHS[@]}"; do
  report_basename="$(basename "$report")"
  # Get metadata from previously extracted REPORT_METADATA array
  metadata="${REPORT_METADATA[$report_basename]}"
  RESEARCH_METADATA_LIST+="- Path: $report\n"
  RESEARCH_METADATA_LIST+="  Metadata: $metadata\n"
done

# Include overview if created (only for research-only workflows)
if [ -n "$OVERVIEW_PATH" ] && [ -f "$OVERVIEW_PATH" ]; then
  RESEARCH_METADATA_LIST+="- Path: $OVERVIEW_PATH (synthesis)\n"
fi

# Discover standards file
STANDARDS_FILE="${LOCATION}/CLAUDE.md"
if [ ! -f "$STANDARDS_FILE" ]; then
  STANDARDS_FILE="${LOCATION}/.claude/CLAUDE.md"
fi
if [ ! -f "$STANDARDS_FILE" ]; then
  STANDARDS_FILE="(none found)"
fi

echo "Planning Context:"
echo "  Research Reports: $SUCCESSFUL_REPORT_COUNT files (metadata only)"
echo "  Context Reduction: 95% (metadata instead of full reports)"
echo "  Standards File: $STANDARDS_FILE"
echo ""
```

### Plan-Architect Agent Invocation

STEP 2: Invoke plan-architect agent via Task tool

**EXECUTE NOW**: USE the Task tool with these parameters:

- subagent_type: "general-purpose"
- description: "Create implementation plan with mandatory file creation"
- prompt: |
    Read and follow ALL behavioral guidelines from: .claude/agents/plan-architect.md

    **Workflow-Specific Context**:
    - Workflow Description: $WORKFLOW_DESCRIPTION
    - Plan File Path: $PLAN_PATH (absolute path, pre-calculated by orchestrator)
    - Project Standards: $STANDARDS_FILE
    - Research Reports (metadata only, 95% context reduction): $RESEARCH_METADATA_LIST
    - Research Report Count: $SUCCESSFUL_REPORT_COUNT

    **IMPORTANT**: Research reports provided as metadata only for context efficiency.
    Full reports are available at the paths listed if detailed review is needed.

    **CRITICAL**: Before writing plan file, ensure parent directory exists:
    Use Bash tool: mkdir -p "$(dirname "$PLAN_PATH")"

    Execute planning following all guidelines in behavioral file.
    Return: PLAN_CREATED: $PLAN_PATH

### Mandatory Verification - Plan Creation

**VERIFICATION REQUIRED**: Plan file must exist before continuing to Phase 3 or completing workflow

**GUARANTEE REQUIRED**: Plan contains minimum 3 phases with standard structure

STEP 3: Verify plan file created successfully (with auto-recovery)

```bash
echo "════════════════════════════════════════════════════════"
echo "  MANDATORY VERIFICATION - Implementation Plan"
echo "════════════════════════════════════════════════════════"
echo ""

# Emit progress marker
emit_progress "2" "Verifying implementation plan"

# Check if file exists and has content (with retry for transient failures)
if retry_with_backoff 2 1000 test -f "$PLAN_PATH" -a -s "$PLAN_PATH"; then
  # Success path - perform quality checks
  PHASE_COUNT=$(grep -c "^### Phase [0-9]" "$PLAN_PATH" || echo "0")

  if [ "$PHASE_COUNT" -lt 3 ]; then
    echo "⚠️  WARNING: Plan has only $PHASE_COUNT phases"
    echo "   Expected at least 3 phases for proper structure."
  fi

  if ! grep -q "^## Metadata" "$PLAN_PATH"; then
    echo "⚠️  WARNING: Plan missing metadata section"
  fi

  echo "✅ VERIFICATION PASSED: Plan created with $PHASE_COUNT phases"
  echo "   Path: $PLAN_PATH"
  echo ""

  # VERIFICATION REQUIREMENT: YOU MUST NOT proceed without plan file
  echo "Verification checkpoint passed - proceeding to plan metadata extraction"
  echo ""
else
  # Failure path - extract error info and attempt recovery
  ERROR_MSG="Plan file missing or empty: $PLAN_PATH"
  ERROR_LOCATION=$(extract_error_location "$ERROR_MSG")
  ERROR_TYPE=$(detect_specific_error_type "$ERROR_MSG")

  # Classify error for retry decision
  RETRY_DECISION=$(classify_and_retry "$ERROR_MSG")

  if [ "$RETRY_DECISION" == "retry" ]; then
    echo "⚠️  TRANSIENT ERROR: Retrying once..."
    sleep 1

    if retry_with_backoff 2 1000 test -f "$PLAN_PATH" -a -s "$PLAN_PATH"; then
      PHASE_COUNT=$(grep -c "^### Phase [0-9]" "$PLAN_PATH" || echo "0")
      echo "✅ RETRY SUCCESSFUL: Plan created with $PHASE_COUNT phases"
    else
      echo "❌ RETRY FAILED: Plan still missing"
      echo ""
      echo "ERROR: $ERROR_TYPE"
      if [ -n "$ERROR_LOCATION" ]; then
        echo "   at $ERROR_LOCATION"
      fi
      echo ""
      echo "Recovery suggestions:"
      suggest_recovery_actions "$ERROR_TYPE" "$ERROR_LOCATION" "$ERROR_MSG"
      echo ""
      echo "Workflow TERMINATED."
      exit 1
    fi
  else
    # Permanent error - fail fast
    echo "❌ PERMANENT ERROR: $ERROR_TYPE"
    if [ -n "$ERROR_LOCATION" ]; then
      echo "   at $ERROR_LOCATION"
    fi
    echo ""
    echo "Recovery suggestions:"
    suggest_recovery_actions "$ERROR_TYPE" "$ERROR_LOCATION" "$ERROR_MSG"
    echo ""
    echo "Workflow TERMINATED."
    exit 1
  fi
fi
```

### Plan Metadata Extraction

STEP 4: Extract plan metadata for reporting

```bash
# Extract complexity from plan
PLAN_COMPLEXITY=$(grep "Complexity:" "$PLAN_PATH" | head -1 | cut -d: -f2 | xargs || echo "unknown")

# Extract estimated time
PLAN_EST_TIME=$(grep "Estimated Total Time:" "$PLAN_PATH" | cut -d: -f2 | xargs || echo "unknown")

echo "Plan Metadata:"
echo "  Phases: $PHASE_COUNT"
echo "  Complexity: $PLAN_COMPLEXITY"
echo "  Est. Time: $PLAN_EST_TIME"
echo ""

echo "Phase 2 Complete: Implementation plan created"
echo ""

# Save checkpoint after Phase 2
ARTIFACT_PATHS_JSON=$(cat <<EOF
{
  "research_reports": [$(printf '"%s",' "${SUCCESSFUL_REPORT_PATHS[@]}" | sed 's/,$//')]
  $([ -n "$OVERVIEW_PATH" ] && [ -f "$OVERVIEW_PATH" ] && echo ', "overview_path": "'$OVERVIEW_PATH'",' || echo '')
  "plan_path": "$PLAN_PATH"
}
EOF
)
save_checkpoint "supervise" "phase_2" "$ARTIFACT_PATHS_JSON"
```

### Workflow Completion Check (After Phase 2)

STEP 5: Check if workflow should continue to implementation

```bash
should_run_phase 3 || {
  echo "════════════════════════════════════════════════════════"
  echo "         /supervise WORKFLOW COMPLETE"
  echo "════════════════════════════════════════════════════════"
  echo ""
  echo "Workflow Type: $WORKFLOW_SCOPE"
  echo "Phases Executed: Phase 0-2 (Location, Research, Planning)"
  echo ""
  echo "Artifacts Created:"
  echo "  ✓ Research Reports: $SUCCESSFUL_REPORT_COUNT files"
  for report in "${SUCCESSFUL_REPORT_PATHS[@]}"; do
    echo "      - $(basename $report)"
  done
  if [ -n "$OVERVIEW_PATH" ] && [ -f "$OVERVIEW_PATH" ]; then
    echo "  ✓ Research Overview: $(basename $OVERVIEW_PATH)"
  fi
  echo "  ✓ Implementation Plan: $(basename $PLAN_PATH)"
  echo ""
  echo "Standards Compliance:"
  echo "  ✓ Reports in specs/reports/ (not inline summaries)"
  echo "  ✓ Plan created via Task tool (not SlashCommand)"
  echo "  ✓ Summary NOT created (per standards - no implementation)"
  echo ""
  echo "Next Steps:"
  echo "  The plan is ready for execution"
  echo ""
  exit 0
}
```

## Phase 3: Implementation

[EXECUTION-CRITICAL: Agent invocation patterns and verification - templates must be inline]

**Objective**: Execute implementation plan phase-by-phase with testing and commits.

**Pattern**: Invoke code-writer agent with plan context → Verify implementation artifacts → Track completion

**Critical**: Code-writer agent uses phase-by-phase execution pattern internally (with testing and commits after each phase)

### Phase 3 Execution Check

```bash
should_run_phase 3 || {
  echo "⏭️  Skipping Phase 3 (Implementation)"
  echo "  Reason: Workflow type is $WORKFLOW_SCOPE"
  echo ""
  # Continue to next phase check or completion
}
```

### Code-Writer Agent Invocation

STEP 1: Invoke code-writer agent with plan context

**EXECUTE NOW**: USE the Task tool with these parameters:

- subagent_type: "general-purpose"
- description: "Execute implementation plan with mandatory artifact creation"
- prompt: |
    Read and follow ALL behavioral guidelines from: .claude/agents/code-writer.md

    **Workflow-Specific Context**:
    - Plan File Path: $PLAN_PATH (absolute path, pre-calculated by orchestrator)
    - Implementation Artifacts Directory: $IMPL_ARTIFACTS
    - Project Standards: $STANDARDS_FILE
    - Workflow Type: $WORKFLOW_SCOPE

    **CRITICAL**: Before writing any artifact files, ensure parent directories exist:
    Use Bash tool: mkdir -p "$(dirname "<file_path>")" before each file creation

    Execute implementation following all guidelines in behavioral file.
    Return: IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS: {complete|partial|failed}
    PHASES_COMPLETED: {N}
    PHASES_TOTAL: {M}
```

### Mandatory Verification - Implementation Completion

**VERIFICATION REQUIRED**: Implementation artifacts directory must exist

**CHECKPOINT REQUIREMENT**: Report implementation status to determine Phase 6 execution

STEP 2: Verify implementation artifacts created

```bash
echo "════════════════════════════════════════════════════════"
echo "  MANDATORY VERIFICATION - Implementation"
echo "════════════════════════════════════════════════════════"
echo ""

  exit 1
else

}
EOF
)
save_checkpoint "supervise" "phase_3" "$ARTIFACT_PATHS_JSON"
```

## Phase 4: Testing

[EXECUTION-CRITICAL: Agent invocation patterns and verification - templates must be inline]

**Objective**: Execute comprehensive test suite and collect results.

**Pattern**: Invoke test-specialist agent → Verify test results → Determine if debugging needed

**Critical**: Test results determine whether Phase 5 (Debug) executes

### Phase 4 Execution Check

```bash
should_run_phase 4 || {
  echo "⏭️  Skipping Phase 4 (Testing)"
  echo "  Reason: Workflow type is $WORKFLOW_SCOPE"
  echo ""
  # Continue to next phase check or completion
}
```

### Test-Specialist Agent Invocation

STEP 1: Invoke test-specialist agent

**EXECUTE NOW**: USE the Task tool with these parameters:

- subagent_type: "general-purpose"
- description: "Execute comprehensive tests with mandatory results file"
- prompt: |
    Read and follow ALL behavioral guidelines from: .claude/agents/test-specialist.md

    **Workflow-Specific Context**:

    - Project Standards: $STANDARDS_FILE
    - Plan File: $PLAN_PATH
    - Implementation Artifacts: $IMPL_ARTIFACTS

    **CRITICAL**: Before writing test results file, ensure parent directory exists:
    Use Bash tool: mkdir -p "$TOPIC_PATH/outputs"

    Execute testing following all guidelines in behavioral file.
    Return: TEST_STATUS: {passing|failing}
    TESTS_TOTAL: {N}
    TESTS_PASSED: {M}
    TESTS_FAILED: {K}

### Test Results Verification

**VERIFICATION REQUIRED**: Test results file must exist to determine Phase 5 execution

**CHECKPOINT REQUIREMENT**: Report test status to determine if debugging needed

STEP 2: Parse and verify test results

```bash
echo "════════════════════════════════════════════════════════"
echo "  MANDATORY VERIFICATION - Test Results"
echo "════════════════════════════════════════════════════════"
echo ""

# Parse test status from agent output
TEST_STATUS=$(echo "$AGENT_OUTPUT" | grep "TEST_STATUS:" | cut -d: -f2 | xargs)

}
EOF
)
save_checkpoint "supervise" "phase_4" "$ARTIFACT_PATHS_JSON"
```

## Phase 5: Debug (Conditional)

[EXECUTION-CRITICAL: Agent invocation patterns and verification - templates must be inline]

**Objective**: Analyze test failures and apply fixes iteratively.

**Pattern**: Invoke debug-analyst → Apply fixes → Re-run tests (max 3 iterations)

**Execution Condition**: Phase 5 executes if tests failed OR workflow is debug-only

### Phase 5 Execution Check

```bash
# Phase 5 only executes if tests failed OR workflow is debug-only
if [ "$TESTS_PASSING" == "false" ] || [ "$WORKFLOW_SCOPE" == "debug-only" ]; then
  echo "Executing Phase 5: Debug"
  echo ""
else
  echo "⏭️  Skipping Phase 5 (Debug)"
  echo "  Reason: Tests passing, no debugging needed"
  echo ""
  # Continue to Phase 6
fi
```

### Debug Iteration Loop

STEP 1: Iterate debug cycle (max 3 iterations)

```bash
# Maximum 3 debug iterations
for iteration in 1 2 3; do
  echo "════════════════════════════════════════════════════════"
  echo "  DEBUG ITERATION $iteration / 3"
  echo "════════════════════════════════════════════════════════"
  echo ""

  # Invoke debug-analyst agent
  Task {
    subagent_type: "general-purpose"
    description: "Analyze test failures - iteration $iteration"
    prompt: "
      Read behavioral guidelines: .claude/agents/debug-analyst.md

      **PRIMARY OBLIGATION - Debug Report File**

      **ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENT**: Creating debug report is MANDATORY.

      **WHY THIS MATTERS**:
      - Fix application depends on debug report existing
      - Root cause analysis must be documented for review
      - Iteration tracking requires file artifacts
      - Cannot apply fixes without documented analysis

      ---

      **STEP 1 (REQUIRED BEFORE STEP 2) - Create Debug Report**

      **EXECUTE NOW**

      First, ensure parent directory exists:
      ```bash
      mkdir -p "$(dirname "${DEBUG_REPORT}")"
      ```

      Then create: ${DEBUG_REPORT}

      Template:
      ```markdown
      # Debug Analysis - Iteration $iteration

      ## Test Failures Summary
      [To be populated in STEP 2]

      ## Root Cause Analysis
      [To be populated in STEP 3]

      ## Proposed Fixes
      [To be populated in STEP 3]
      ```

      ---

      **STEP 2 (REQUIRED BEFORE STEP 3) - Analyze Failures**

      Read: ${TOPIC_PATH}/outputs/test_results.md

      **EXTRACT**:
      - Each failing test name
      - Error messages
      - Stack traces
      - File locations

      ---

      **STEP 3 (REQUIRED BEFORE STEP 4) - Determine Root Causes**

      For EACH failing test:
      1. Identify root cause
      2. Determine affected files
      3. Propose specific fix with code
      4. Assign priority

      **POPULATE REPORT** using Edit tool

      ---

      **STEP 4 (MANDATORY VERIFICATION)**

      **VERIFY**:
      ```bash
      test -f \"${DEBUG_REPORT}\"
      grep -q \"^## Root Cause Analysis\" \"${DEBUG_REPORT}\"
      ```

      **COMPLETION CRITERIA - ALL REQUIRED**:
      - [x] Debug report exists at ${DEBUG_REPORT}
      - [x] Report contains Test Failures Summary
      - [x] Report contains Root Cause Analysis
      - [x] Report contains Proposed Fixes
      - [x] Return confirmation in exact format

      **RETURN**: DEBUG_ANALYSIS_COMPLETE: ${DEBUG_REPORT}

      **DO NOT** return full analysis text. Return ONLY confirmation above.

      ---

      **ORCHESTRATOR VERIFICATION**:
      1. Verify debug report exists
      2. Extract proposed fixes
      3. Pass to code-writer for fix application

      **REMINDER**: You are the EXECUTOR. Use exact path provided.

    description: "Apply debug fixes - iteration $iteration"
    prompt: "
      Read behavioral guidelines: .claude/agents/code-writer.md

      **PRIMARY OBLIGATION - Apply All Fixes**

      **ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENT**: Applying all proposed fixes is MANDATORY.

      **WHY THIS MATTERS**:
      - Test re-run depends on fixes being applied
      - Partial fix application may not resolve failures
      - Iteration success requires complete fix implementation

      ---

      **STEP 1 (REQUIRED BEFORE STEP 2) - Read Debug Analysis**

      YOU MUST read debug analysis: ${DEBUG_REPORT}

      **ANALYSIS REQUIREMENTS**:
      - Review all proposed fixes
      - Understand priority order
      - Note file locations and line numbers

      ---

      **STEP 2 (REQUIRED BEFORE STEP 3) - Apply Recommended Fixes**

      **EXECUTE NOW - Use Edit Tool**

      For each fix:
      - Locate the file and line number
      - Apply the exact code change recommended
      - Preserve code style and formatting
      - Do NOT skip any fixes

      **CHECKPOINT**: After EACH fix applied:
      ```
      PROGRESS: Fix N applied to [file]
      ```

      ---

      **STEP 3 (REQUIRED BEFORE STEP 4) - Verify Fixes Applied**

      YOU MUST verify all changes were successfully made:

      ```bash
      # Count modified files
      git status --short | wc -l
      ```

      **VERIFICATION REQUIREMENTS**:
      - Check that all changes were successfully made
      - Count the number of files modified
      - Verify no syntax errors introduced

      ---

      **STEP 4 (MANDATORY) - Return Fix Status**

      **RETURN FORMAT**:
      ```
      FIXES_APPLIED: {count}
      FILES_MODIFIED: {list of file paths}
      ```

      **DO NOT** return full diff or code listings.
      Return ONLY status metadata above.

      ---

      **ORCHESTRATOR VERIFICATION**:
      1. Parse fixes applied count
      2. Prepare for test re-run
      3. Determine if fixes resolved failures

      **STANDARDS COMPLIANCE**:
      - Follow code standards from: ${STANDARDS_FILE}
      - Maintain existing indentation and style
      - Add comments for complex fixes if needed

      **REMINDER**: You are the EXECUTOR. Apply all fixes methodically.

    prompt: "
      Read behavioral guidelines: .claude/agents/test-specialist.md

      **EXECUTE NOW - RE-RUN TESTS**

      STEP 1: Discover test commands from standards: ${STANDARDS_FILE}

      STEP 2: Run project test suite
              Execute the same tests that were run in Phase 4

      STEP 3: Update test results report: ${TOPIC_PATH}/outputs/test_results.md
              Append results from this iteration
              Note which iteration this is (iteration $iteration)

      STEP 4: Return test status:
              TEST_STATUS: {passing|failing}
              TESTS_TOTAL: {N}
              TESTS_PASSED: {M}
              TESTS_FAILED: {K}

      **REMINDER**: You are the EXECUTOR. Run the tests now.

## Phase 6: Documentation (Conditional)

[EXECUTION-CRITICAL: Agent invocation patterns and verification - templates must be inline]

**Objective**: Create workflow summary linking plan, research, and implementation.

**Pattern**: Invoke doc-writer agent → Verify summary created → Update research reports

**Execution Condition**: Phase 6 only executes if implementation occurred (Phase 3 ran)

### Phase 6 Execution Check

```bash
# Phase 6 only executes if implementation occurred
if [ "$IMPLEMENTATION_OCCURRED" == "true" ]; then
  echo "Executing Phase 6: Documentation"
  echo ""
else
  echo "⏭️  Skipping Phase 6 (Documentation)"
  echo "  Reason: No implementation to document (scope: $WORKFLOW_SCOPE)"
  echo ""
  # Skip to completion summary
  display_brief_summary
  exit 0
fi
```

### Doc-Writer Agent Invocation

STEP 1: Invoke doc-writer agent to create summary

**EXECUTE NOW**: USE the Task tool with these parameters:

- subagent_type: "general-purpose"
- description: "Create workflow summary with mandatory file creation"
- prompt: |
    Read and follow ALL behavioral guidelines from: .claude/agents/doc-writer.md

    **Workflow-Specific Context**:
    - Summary Path: $SUMMARY_PATH (absolute path, pre-calculated)
    - Plan File: $PLAN_PATH
    - Research Reports: $RESEARCH_REPORTS_LIST
    - Implementation Artifacts: $IMPL_ARTIFACTS
    - Test Status: $TEST_STATUS
    - Workflow Description: $WORKFLOW_DESCRIPTION

    **CRITICAL**: Before writing summary file, ensure parent directory exists:
    Use Bash tool: mkdir -p "$(dirname "$SUMMARY_PATH")"

    Execute documentation following all guidelines in behavioral file.
    Return: SUMMARY_CREATED: $SUMMARY_PATH

### Mandatory Verification - Summary Creation

**VERIFICATION REQUIRED**: Summary file must exist to complete workflow

**GUARANTEE REQUIRED**: Summary links all artifacts (research, plan, implementation)

STEP 2: Verify summary file created

```bash
echo "════════════════════════════════════════════════════════"
echo "  MANDATORY VERIFICATION - Workflow Summary"
echo "════════════════════════════════════════════════════════"
echo ""

# Check if summary file exists and has content (with retry for transient failures)
if ! retry_with_backoff 2 1000 test -f "$SUMMARY_PATH" -a -s "$SUMMARY_PATH"; then
  echo "❌ CRITICAL ERROR: Summary file not created after retries at $SUMMARY_PATH"
  echo ""
  echo "FALLBACK MECHANISM: Cannot create summary without agent - workflow incomplete"
  echo "Workflow TERMINATED."
  exit 1
fi

echo "✅ VERIFIED: Summary file exists at $SUMMARY_PATH"
FILE_SIZE=$(wc -c < "$SUMMARY_PATH")
echo "   File size: $FILE_SIZE bytes"
echo ""

# VERIFICATION REQUIREMENT: YOU MUST NOT complete workflow without summary
echo "Verification checkpoint passed - workflow complete"
echo ""

echo "Phase 6 Complete: Documentation finished"
echo ""
```

## Workflow Completion

Display final workflow summary and artifact locations.

```bash
# Clean up checkpoint on successful completion
CHECKPOINT_FILE=".claude/data/checkpoints/supervise_latest.json"
if [ -f "$CHECKPOINT_FILE" ]; then
  rm -f "$CHECKPOINT_FILE"
  echo "✓ Checkpoint cleaned up"
  echo ""
fi

display_brief_summary
exit 0
```
