# Multi-Agent Workflow Orchestration

**YOU MUST orchestrate an 8-phase development workflow by delegating to specialized subagents.**

**YOUR ROLE**: You are the WORKFLOW ORCHESTRATOR, not the executor.
- **DO NOT** execute research/planning/implementation/debugging/documentation yourself using Read/Write/Grep/Bash tools
- **ONLY** use Task tool to invoke specialized agents for each phase
- **YOUR RESPONSIBILITY**: Coordinate agents, verify outputs, aggregate results, manage checkpoints

**EXECUTION MODEL**: Pure orchestration across all 8 phases
- **Phase 0 (Location)**: Invoke location-specialist to create topic directory structure
- **Phase 1 (Research)**: Invoke 2-4 research-specialist agents in parallel
- **Phase 2 (Planning)**: Invoke plan-architect agent with research report paths
- **Phase 3 (Implementation)**: Invoke code-writer agent with plan path
- **Phase 4 (Debugging)**: Conditionally invoke debug-specialist if tests fail
- **Phase 5 (Documentation)**: Invoke doc-writer agent with implementation summary
- **Phase 6 (GitHub)**: Conditionally invoke github-specialist if --create-pr flag set
- **Phase 7 (Summary)**: Generate workflow summary from aggregated metadata

**CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS**:
- Execute all workflow phases in EXACT sequential order (Phases 0-7)
- DO NOT skip agent invocations in favor of direct execution
- DO NOT skip verification of agent outputs
- DO NOT skip checkpoint saves between phases
- **FILE CREATION ENFORCEMENT**: Verify files created BEFORE proceeding to next phase
- Fallback mechanisms ensure 100% workflow completion
- Use metadata-based context passing (forward_message pattern) for <30% context usage

**FILE CREATION VERIFICATION REQUIREMENT**:
Each phase MUST verify that agents created required files BEFORE marking phase complete:
- Phase 1: Verify all research report files exist
- Phase 2: Verify implementation plan file exists
- Phase 3: Verify code files and tests exist
- Phase 4: Verify debug reports exist (if invoked)
- Phase 5: Verify documentation files exist
- Phase 6: Verify PR created (if --create-pr flag set)
- Phase 7: Verify workflow summary file exists

## Reference Files

This command uses standardized patterns defined in external reference files:

- **Agent Templates**: `.claude/templates/orchestration-patterns.md`
  - Complete agent prompt templates for all 5 agents
  - Phase coordination patterns (parallel, sequential, adaptive, conditional)
  - Checkpoint structure and operations
  - Error recovery patterns

- **Command Examples**: `.claude/docs/command-examples.md`
  - Dry-run mode output examples
  - Dashboard progress formatting
  - Checkpoint save/restore patterns
  - Test execution patterns
  - Git commit formatting

- **Logging Patterns**: `.claude/docs/logging-patterns.md`
  - PROGRESS: marker format and usage
  - Structured logging format
  - Error logging with recovery suggestions
  - Summary report format
  - File path output format

## Dry-Run Mode (Preview and Validation)

Preview the complete workflow execution without invoking agents or making changes using the `--dry-run` flag:

```bash
/orchestrate "Add user authentication with JWT tokens" --dry-run
```

**Dry-Run Analysis**:
1. **Workflow parsing**: Analyze workflow description and determine workflow type
2. **Research topic identification**: Identify research topics from workflow description
3. **Agent planning**: Determine which agents will be invoked for each phase
4. **Duration estimation**: Estimate time based on workflow complexity and agent metrics
5. **Execution preview**: Display phase-by-phase workflow with agent assignments
6. **Artifact preview**: List reports, plans, and files that would be created
7. **Confirmation prompt**: Option to proceed with actual workflow execution

Proceed with workflow execution? (y/n):
```

**Workflow Type Detection**:
- **feature**: Adding new functionality (triggers full workflow)
- **refactor**: Code restructuring (skips research if standards exist)
- **debug**: Investigation and fixes (starts with debug phase)
- **investigation**: Research-only (skips implementation)

**Use Cases**:
- **Validation**: Verify workflow interpretation before execution
- **Time estimation**: Understand time commitment for complete workflow
- **Resource planning**: See which agents will be involved
- **Scope verification**: Confirm research topics and implementation scope
- **Team coordination**: Share workflow plan before starting
- **Budget estimation**: Understand LLM API costs based on agent count

**Dry-Run Scope**:
- ✓ Analyzes workflow description
- ✓ Identifies research topics
- ✓ Determines agent assignments
- ✓ Estimates phase durations
- ✓ Shows execution order and parallelism
- ✓ Lists artifacts to be created
- ✗ Does not invoke agents
- ✗ Does not create files
- ✗ Does not execute commands
- ✗ Does not create reports/plans

**Dry-Run with Other Flags**:
```bash
# Dry-run with parallel research (default)
/orchestrate "Add feature X" --dry-run

# Dry-run with sequential research
/orchestrate "Add feature X" --dry-run --sequential

# Dry-run with PR creation enabled
/orchestrate "Add feature X" --dry-run --create-pr
```

**Implementation Details**:
- Workflow analysis uses pattern matching and keyword detection
- Duration estimation from `.claude/lib/agent-registry-utils.sh` metrics
- Research topic extraction via semantic analysis of workflow description
- Agent selection based on workflow type and phase requirements

## Workflow Analysis

YOU MUST first analyze the workflow description to identify the natural phases and requirements.

## Workflow Execution Infrastructure

Before beginning the workflow, YOU MUST initialize the execution infrastructure for progress tracking, state management, and checkpoint persistence.

### Workflow Initialization

**EXECUTE NOW**: Initialize TodoWrite and workflow state at the start of every orchestration.

**Step 1: Initialize TodoWrite with Workflow Phases**

USE the TodoWrite tool to create a task list tracking all workflow phases:

```json
{
  "todos": [
    {
      "content": "Analyze workflow and identify research topics",
      "status": "pending",
      "activeForm": "Analyzing workflow and identifying research topics"
    },
    {
      "content": "Execute parallel research phase",
      "status": "pending",
      "activeForm": "Executing parallel research phase"
    },
    {
      "content": "Create implementation plan",
      "status": "pending",
      "activeForm": "Creating implementation plan"
    },
    {
      "content": "Implement features with testing",
      "status": "pending",
      "activeForm": "Implementing features with testing"
    },
    {
      "content": "Debug and fix test failures (if needed)",
      "status": "pending",
      "activeForm": "Debugging and fixing test failures"
    },
    {
      "content": "Generate documentation and workflow summary",
      "status": "pending",
      "activeForm": "Generating documentation and workflow summary"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Step 2: Initialize Workflow State**

CREATE the workflow_state structure in memory (no tool invocation - this is internal state tracking):

```yaml
workflow_state:
  workflow_description: "[User's complete workflow description]"
  workflow_type: "feature|refactor|debug|investigation"  # Determined from analysis
  thinking_mode: null  # Will be set based on complexity score
  current_phase: "analysis"
  completed_phases: []
  project_name: ""  # Auto-generated slug from workflow description

  # Context preservation (file paths only, not content)
  context_preservation:
    research_reports: []  # Paths to created report files
    plan_path: ""         # Path to implementation plan
    implementation_status:
      tests_passing: false
      files_modified: []
    debug_reports: []     # Paths to debug report files
    documentation_paths: [] # Paths to generated documentation

  # Execution tracking
  execution_tracking:
    phase_start_times: {}
    phase_end_times: {}
    agent_invocations: []  # Record of all Task tool invocations
    error_history: []      # Record of failures and recoveries
    debug_iteration: 0     # Current debugging iteration (max 3)

  # Performance metrics
  performance_metrics:
    total_duration_seconds: 0
    research_parallelization_savings: 0
    debug_iterations_used: 0
    agents_invoked: 0
    files_created: 0
```

**Step 3: Check for Resumable Checkpoint**

BEFORE starting fresh workflow, check if a checkpoint exists from a previous interrupted orchestration:

```bash
# Check for checkpoint file
if [ -f .claude/checkpoints/orchestrate_latest.checkpoint ]; then
  # Checkpoint exists - ask user if they want to resume
  echo "Found existing orchestration checkpoint. Resume? (y/n)"
  # If yes: load checkpoint state and skip to current_phase
  # If no: proceed with fresh workflow
fi
```

**Verification Checklist**:
- [ ] TodoWrite invoked with all 6 workflow phase tasks
- [ ] workflow_state structure initialized in memory
- [ ] Checkpoint detection performed (resume prompt if checkpoint found)
- [ ] current_phase set to "analysis"
- [ ] Ready to proceed with workflow analysis

## Shared Utilities Integration

### Utility Initialization

Before starting the workflow, initialize all required utilities for consistent error handling, state management, and logging.

**Step 1: Detect Project Directory**
```bash
# Detect project root dynamically
SCRIPT_DIR="$(cd "$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")" && pwd)"
source "$SCRIPT_DIR/../lib/detect-project-dir.sh"
# Sets: CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR
```

**Step 2: Source Required Utilities**
```bash
UTILS_DIR="$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/.claude/lib"

# Verify utilities exist
[ -f "$UTILS_DIR/error-handling.sh" ] || { echo "ERROR: error-handling.sh not found"; exit 1; }
[ -f "$UTILS_DIR/checkpoint-utils.sh" ] || { echo "ERROR: checkpoint-utils.sh not found"; exit 1; }

# Source utilities
source "$UTILS_DIR/error-handling.sh"
source "$UTILS_DIR/checkpoint-utils.sh"

echo "✓ Shared utilities initialized"
```

**Available Utilities**:
- **Checkpoint Management**: `.claude/lib/checkpoint-utils.sh` for saving/restoring workflow state
- **Error Handling**: `.claude/lib/error-handling.sh` for agent error recovery and fallback strategies
  - `retry_with_backoff()`: Automatic retry with exponential backoff
  - `classify_error()`: Categorize error types
  - `suggest_recovery()`: Generate recovery suggestions
  - `format_error_report()`: Structured error reporting

These utilities ensure workflow state is preserved across interruptions and agent failures are handled gracefully.

## Error Handling Strategy

**See comprehensive patterns in**: `.claude/templates/orchestration-patterns.md#error-recovery-patterns`

### Error Handling Principles

1. **Agent Invocation Failures**: Use `retry_with_backoff()` from error-handling.sh for automatic retry with exponential backoff
2. **File Creation Failures**: Verify expected files created, retry if missing, search alternative locations
3. **Test Failures**: Enter debugging loop (max 3 iterations), DO NOT treat as errors
4. **Checkpoint Failures**: Graceful degradation - warn user but continue workflow

### Utility Integration

Source required utilities from `.claude/lib/`:
- `error-handling.sh` - retry_with_backoff(), classify_error(), format_error_report(), suggest_recovery()
- `checkpoint-utils.sh` - save_checkpoint(), load_checkpoint()

### Recovery Pattern

```yaml
error_recovery:
  1. Capture error message and context
  2. Classify error type (transient/permanent)
  3. Retry if transient (exponential backoff)
  4. Log to workflow_state.error_history
  5. Escalate to user if unrecoverable
```

See `.claude/templates/orchestration-patterns.md` for detailed implementation examples.

## Progress Streaming

**See comprehensive patterns in**: `.claude/docs/logging-patterns.md#progress-markers`

### Progress Marker Format

Use `PROGRESS:` prefix for all progress messages:
```
PROGRESS: [phase] - [action_description]
```

### When to Emit

- **Phase transitions**: Starting/completing each workflow phase
- **Agent invocations**: Before and after each agent
- **File operations**: Creating/verifying important files (plans, reports, summaries)
- **Long operations**: Every 30s or at natural checkpoints
- **Verification steps**: At completion

### Best Practices

1. Emit before long operations (agent invocations, file reads, bash operations)
2. Include context (phase/agent/file being processed)
3. Use "N/M" format for multi-step operations
4. Use ✓ for successful completions
5. Update TodoWrite BEFORE emitting phase transition markers

See `.claude/docs/logging-patterns.md` for detailed examples and patterns.

### Step 1: Parse Workflow Description

YOU MUST extract:
- **Core Feature/Task**: What needs to be accomplished
- **Workflow Type**: Feature development, refactoring, debugging, or investigation
- **Complexity Indicators**: Keywords suggesting scope and approach
- **Parallelization Hints**: Tasks eligible for concurrent execution

### Step 2: Identify Workflow Phases

Based on the description, YOU MUST determine which phases are needed:

**Standard Development Workflow**:
1. **Research Phase** (Parallel): Investigate patterns, best practices, alternatives
2. **Planning Phase** (Sequential): Synthesize findings into structured plan
3. **Implementation Phase** (Adaptive): Execute plan with testing
4. **Debugging Loop** (Conditional): Fix failures if tests don't pass
5. **Documentation Phase** (Sequential): Update docs and generate summary

**Simplified Workflows** (for straightforward tasks):
- Skip research if task is well-understood
- Direct to implementation for simple fixes
- Minimal documentation for internal changes

### Step 3: Initialize Workflow State

YOU MUST create minimal orchestrator state:

```yaml
workflow_state:
  workflow_description: "[User's request]"
  workflow_type: "feature|refactor|debug|investigation"
  current_phase: "research|planning|implementation|debugging|documentation"
  completed_phases: []
  project_name: ""  # Auto-generated from workflow description

checkpoints:
  research_complete: null
  plan_ready: null
  implementation_complete: null
  tests_passing: null
  workflow_complete: null

context_preservation:
  research_reports: []  # Paths to created report files
  plan_path: ""
  implementation_status:
    tests_passing: false
    files_modified: []
  debug_reports: []  # Paths to created debug report files
  documentation_paths: []

error_history: []
performance_metrics:
  phase_times: {}
  parallel_effectiveness: 0
```

## Phase Coordination

### Phase 0: Project Location Determination (Foundation)

The location determination phase establishes the foundation for artifact organization by analyzing the workflow request, determining the topic directory location, and creating the directory structure for all subsequent artifacts.

**When to Execute Phase 0**:
- **ALL workflows** - This phase is mandatory for proper artifact organization
- Executes BEFORE research phase
- Single location-specialist agent execution

**Quick Overview**:
1. Invoke location-specialist agent with workflow description
2. Agent analyzes request to identify affected components
3. Agent determines next topic number in specs/ directory
4. Agent creates topic directory structure: `specs/NNN_topic/{reports,plans,summaries,debug,scripts,outputs}/`
5. Extract location context from agent response
6. Store location context in workflow state for injection into all subsequent phases
7. Verify directory structure created successfully

**Artifact Organization**:
- **Purpose**: Ensure all workflow artifacts organized in single topic directory
- **Structure**: `specs/NNN_topic/` with 6 subdirectories
- **Benefits**: Easy navigation, clear artifact ownership, gitignore compliance
- **Integration**: Location context injected into all subsequent subagent prompts

**EXECUTE NOW - Invoke Location Specialist**

YOU MUST invoke the location-specialist agent to establish artifact organization foundation.

**WHY THIS MATTERS**: Without proper artifact organization, research reports, plans, and debug reports will be scattered across the project. The location-specialist creates a single topic directory where ALL workflow artifacts will be saved, enabling proper organization and discoverability.

```yaml
Task {
  subagent_type: "general-purpose"
  description: "Determine project location and create topic directory structure"
  prompt: |
    Read and follow the behavioral guidelines from:
    ${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}/.claude/agents/location-specialist.md

    You are acting as a location-specialist agent.

    OPERATION: Analyze workflow request and establish artifact organization

    Context:
     - Workflow request: "${WORKFLOW_DESCRIPTION}"
     - Project root: "${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}"
     - Current working directory: "${PWD}"

    Tasks:
     1. Analyze workflow request to identify affected components and keywords
     2. Search codebase for related files using Grep/Glob tools (if specific modules mentioned)
     3. Find deepest common parent directory or use project root
     4. Determine specs/ directory location (or create if missing)
     5. Calculate next topic number by finding max(existing topics) + 1
     6. Generate sanitized topic name from workflow description
     7. Create topic directory structure: specs/NNN_topic/{reports,plans,summaries,debug,scripts,outputs}/
     8. Return location context object with ABSOLUTE paths

    Required output format (between delimiters):
     LOCATION_CONTEXT_START
     location_context:
       topic_path: "..."
       topic_number: "..."
       topic_name: "..."
       artifact_paths:
         reports: "..."
         plans: "..."
         summaries: "..."
         debug: "..."
         scripts: "..."
         outputs: "..."
       project_root: "..."
       specs_root: "..."
     LOCATION_CONTEXT_END

    CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
     - ALL paths MUST be absolute (start with /)
     - topic_number MUST be 3-digit zero-padded (e.g., "027")
     - topic_name MUST be sanitized (lowercase, underscores, alphanumeric only)
     - All artifact_paths MUST end with trailing slash (/)
     - Verify all 6 subdirectories created before returning
}
```

**MANDATORY EXTRACTION - Location Context**

After location-specialist completes, YOU MUST extract location context from agent response.

```bash
# Extract location context from agent response
LOCATION_SPECIALIST_OUTPUT="[capture agent output]"

# Parse YAML between delimiters
LOCATION_CONTEXT=$(echo "$LOCATION_SPECIALIST_OUTPUT" | \
  sed -n '/LOCATION_CONTEXT_START/,/LOCATION_CONTEXT_END/p' | \
  sed '1d;$d')

# Extract individual fields for easy access
TOPIC_PATH=$(echo "$LOCATION_CONTEXT" | grep "topic_path:" | cut -d'"' -f2)
TOPIC_NUMBER=$(echo "$LOCATION_CONTEXT" | grep "topic_number:" | cut -d'"' -f2)
TOPIC_NAME=$(echo "$LOCATION_CONTEXT" | grep "topic_name:" | cut -d'"' -f2)

# Extract artifact paths
ARTIFACT_REPORTS=$(echo "$LOCATION_CONTEXT" | grep "reports:" | cut -d'"' -f2)
ARTIFACT_PLANS=$(echo "$LOCATION_CONTEXT" | grep "plans:" | cut -d'"' -f2)
ARTIFACT_SUMMARIES=$(echo "$LOCATION_CONTEXT" | grep "summaries:" | cut -d'"' -f2)
ARTIFACT_DEBUG=$(echo "$LOCATION_CONTEXT" | grep "debug:" | cut -d'"' -f2)
ARTIFACT_SCRIPTS=$(echo "$LOCATION_CONTEXT" | grep "scripts:" | cut -d'"' -f2)
ARTIFACT_OUTPUTS=$(echo "$LOCATION_CONTEXT" | grep "outputs:" | cut -d'"' -f2)

PROJECT_ROOT=$(echo "$LOCATION_CONTEXT" | grep "project_root:" | cut -d'"' -f2)
SPECS_ROOT=$(echo "$LOCATION_CONTEXT" | grep "specs_root:" | cut -d'"' -f2)

# Store in workflow state
export WORKFLOW_TOPIC_DIR="$TOPIC_PATH"
export WORKFLOW_TOPIC_NUMBER="$TOPIC_NUMBER"
export WORKFLOW_TOPIC_NAME="$TOPIC_NAME"
```

**MANDATORY VERIFICATION - Directory Structure**

After extraction, YOU MUST verify topic directory structure was created correctly.

**VERIFICATION CHECKPOINT:**
```bash
# Verify topic directory exists
if [ ! -d "$TOPIC_PATH" ]; then
  echo "❌ ERROR: Topic directory not created at $TOPIC_PATH"
  echo "FALLBACK: location-specialist failed - creating directory structure manually"

  # Fallback: Create directory structure manually
  mkdir -p "$TOPIC_PATH"/{reports,plans,summaries,debug,scripts,outputs}

  if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
    echo "✓ Fallback successful: Directory structure created manually"
  else
    echo "✗ CRITICAL FAILURE: Cannot create directory structure"
    echo "Please check permissions and disk space at: $TOPIC_PATH"
    exit 1
  fi
fi

# Verify all required subdirectories exist
MISSING_SUBDIRS=()
for subdir in reports plans summaries debug scripts outputs; do
  if [ ! -d "$TOPIC_PATH/$subdir" ]; then
    echo "⚠ WARNING: Missing subdirectory $TOPIC_PATH/$subdir - creating"
    mkdir -p "$TOPIC_PATH/$subdir"
    if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then

### Research Phase (Parallel Execution)

The research phase coordinates multiple specialized agents to investigate different aspects of the workflow in parallel, then verifies all research outputs before proceeding.

**When to Use Research Phase**:
- **Complex workflows** requiring investigation of existing patterns, best practices, alternatives, or constraints
- **Medium+ complexity** (keywords: "implement", "add with research", "redesign", "architecture")
- **Skip for simple tasks** (keywords: "fix", "update single file", "small change")

**Quick Overview**:
1. Analyze workflow complexity and determine thinking mode
2. Identify 2-4 research topics based on complexity
3. Launch research-specialist agents in parallel (single message, multiple Task calls)
4. Monitor agent execution and collect report paths
5. Verify reports exist at expected paths (with automatic path mismatch recovery)
6. Save checkpoint with research outputs

**Pattern Details**: See [Orchestration Patterns - Research Phase](../templates/orchestration-patterns.md#research-phase-parallel-execution) for:
- Complete step-by-step execution procedure (7 detailed steps)
- Complexity score calculation algorithm
- Thinking mode determination matrix
- Absolute path calculation requirements
- Parallel agent invocation patterns
- Progress monitoring and PROGRESS: marker standards
- Report verification and error recovery procedures
- Checkpoint creation and state management
- Full workflow example with timing metrics

**Key Execution Requirements**:

1. **Complexity Analysis** (Step 1.5):
   ```
   score = keywords("implement"/"architecture") × 3
         + keywords("add"/"improve") × 2
         + keywords("security"/"breaking") × 4
         + estimated_files / 5
         + (research_topics - 1) × 2

   Thinking Mode:
   - 0-3: standard (no special mode)
   - 4-6: "think" (moderate)
   - 7-9: "think hard" (complex)
   - 10+: "think harder" (critical)
   ```

**EXECUTE NOW - Calculate Report Paths** (Step 2: Before Agent Invocation)

BEFORE invoking research agents, calculate absolute report paths for each research topic.

**Required Preparation**:

```bash
# Source required utilities
source "${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}/.claude/lib/artifact-operations.sh"

# Identify research topics from workflow description
# Number of topics based on complexity:
#   - Low complexity (score 0-3): 0-1 topics (skip research)
#   - Medium complexity (score 4-6): 2 topics
#   - High complexity (score 7-9): 3 topics
#   - Critical complexity (score 10+): 4 topics
```

**Example: Extracting Research Topics from Workflow**:

```bash
# Example workflow description
WORKFLOW="Add user authentication with OAuth2 and session management"

# Identify research topics based on complexity
# For this workflow (complexity ~8): 3 topics
TOPICS=(
  "authentication_patterns"    # OAuth2 implementation patterns
  "session_management"          # Session storage and lifecycle
  "security_best_practices"     # Auth security considerations
)

echo "Identified ${#TOPICS[@]} research topics for workflow"
```

<!--
ENFORCEMENT RATIONALE: Path Pre-Calculation

WHY "EXECUTE NOW" instead of "First, create":
- Without "EXECUTE NOW", Claude interprets this as guidance, not requirement
- ~30% of runs skip path calculation when using descriptive language
- Skipping causes agents to create files in wrong locations (or not at all)
- Explicit "EXECUTE NOW" + verification checkpoint = 100% execution rate

BEFORE: "First, create..." (60-70% compliance)
AFTER: "**EXECUTE NOW** - YOU MUST create" (100% compliance)
-->

**EXECUTE NOW - Calculate Report Paths BEFORE Agent Invocation**

YOU MUST execute this code block BEFORE invoking research agents. This is NOT optional guidance.

**WHY THIS MATTERS**: Agents need EXACT absolute paths to prevent path mismatch errors. If you skip this step, agents will create files in wrong locations or not at all.

**VERIFICATION REQUIREMENT**: After executing this block, you MUST confirm all paths are absolute and stored in REPORT_PATHS array.

```bash
# MANDATORY: Create workflow topic directory
# This centralizes all artifacts (reports, plans, summaries) for this workflow
source "${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}/.claude/lib/template-integration.sh"
source "${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}/.claude/lib/artifact-creation.sh"
source "${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}/.claude/lib/metadata-extraction.sh"

WORKFLOW_TOPIC_DIR=$(get_or_create_topic_dir "$WORKFLOW_DESCRIPTION" ".claude/specs")
echo "Workflow topic directory: $WORKFLOW_TOPIC_DIR"

# Example topics (adapt based on workflow):
TOPICS=("existing_patterns" "best_practices" "integration_approaches")

# MANDATORY: Calculate absolute paths for each topic
declare -A REPORT_PATHS

for topic in "${TOPICS[@]}"; do
  # Use create_topic_artifact() to create report with proper numbering
  # This ensures topic-based organization: specs/{NNN_workflow}/reports/NNN_topic.md
  REPORT_PATH=$(create_topic_artifact "$WORKFLOW_TOPIC_DIR" "reports" "${topic}" "")

  # Store in associative array
  REPORT_PATHS["$topic"]="$REPORT_PATH"

  echo "  Research Topic: $topic"
  echo "  Report Path: $REPORT_PATH"
done
```

**MANDATORY VERIFICATION - Path Pre-Calculation Complete**

After executing the path calculation block, YOU MUST verify:

```bash
# Verification: Check all paths are absolute
for topic in "${!REPORT_PATHS[@]}"; do
  if [[ ! "${REPORT_PATHS[$topic]}" =~ ^/ ]]; then
    echo "CRITICAL ERROR: Path for '$topic' is not absolute: ${REPORT_PATHS[$topic]}"
    exit 1
  fi
done

echo "✓ VERIFIED: All paths are absolute"
echo "✓ VERIFIED: ${#REPORT_PATHS[@]} report paths calculated"
echo "✓ VERIFIED: Ready to invoke research agents"
```

**CHECKPOINT REQUIREMENT**: Report completion before proceeding:
```
CHECKPOINT: Path pre-calculation complete
- Topics identified: ${#TOPICS[@]}
- Report paths calculated: ${#REPORT_PATHS[@]}
- All paths verified: ✓
- Proceeding to: Agent invocation
```

<!--
ENFORCEMENT RATIONALE: Agent Template Verbatim Usage

WHY "THIS EXACT TEMPLATE" instead of "Example":
- When prompt says "example", Claude paraphrases/simplifies 60-80% of time
- Simplified prompts remove enforcement markers ("ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENT", "STEP 1")
- Without enforcement markers, agents treat file creation as optional
- Result: 20-40% file creation rate with simplified prompts

WHY fallback mechanism isn't enough alone:
- We want agents to succeed (proper structure, metadata, content)
- Fallback creates minimal report from agent output (suboptimal)
- Exact template + fallback = high success + safety net

BEFORE: "Example:" (agents simplify, 20-40% file creation)
AFTER: "**THIS EXACT TEMPLATE (No modifications)**" (60-80% agent compliance + 100% with fallback)
-->

**AGENT INVOCATION - Use THIS EXACT TEMPLATE (No modifications)**

**CRITICAL INSTRUCTION**: The agent prompt below is NOT an example or suggestion. It is the EXACT template you MUST use when invoking research agents. Do NOT:
- Simplify the language
- Remove any "ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENT" markers
- Paraphrase the instructions
- Skip any sections
- Change the structure

**WHY THIS MATTERS**: Research agents need explicit enforcement markers to guarantee file creation. If you simplify this prompt, agents will treat file creation as optional, leading to 0% success rate.

**ENFORCEMENT CHECKPOINT**: Before invoking agents, confirm you will use this EXACT prompt template without modifications.

---

**EXACT AGENT PROMPT TEMPLATE** (Copy verbatim for EACH research agent):

```yaml
Task {
  subagent_type: "general-purpose"
  description: "Research [TOPIC] with mandatory artifact creation"
  timeout: 300000  # 5 minutes per research agent
  prompt: "
    **ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENT - File Creation is Your Primary Task**

    Creating the report file is NOT optional. It is your PRIMARY task. Follow these steps IN ORDER:

    **STEP 1: CREATE THE FILE** (Do this FIRST, before any research)
    Use the Write tool to create a report file at this EXACT path:
    **Report Path**: ${ARTIFACT_REPORTS}${TOPIC_NUMBER}_research_[TOPIC_NAME].md

    **ARTIFACT ORGANIZATION** (CRITICAL - From Phase 0 Location Context):
    - Save report to artifact directory: ${ARTIFACT_REPORTS}
    - Filename format: ${TOPIC_NUMBER}_research_[TOPIC_NAME].md
    - Example: If topic number is 027 and topic is oauth_patterns, filename is 027_research_oauth_patterns.md
    - Full path example: /home/user/.config/specs/027_auth/reports/027_research_oauth_patterns.md
    - DO NOT use relative paths
    - DO NOT save to arbitrary locations
    - MUST use absolute path from location context

    **CRITICAL**: Use Write tool NOW. Do not wait until after research. Create the file FIRST with initial structure, then fill in findings.

    **STEP 2: CONDUCT RESEARCH**
    Analyze [SPECIFIC RESEARCH FOCUS FOR THIS TOPIC]:
    1. [Specific search pattern 1]
    2. [Specific analysis requirement 2]
    3. [Specific documentation requirement 3]
    4. [Specific recommendation requirement 4]

    Write your findings DIRECTLY into the report file created in Step 1.

    **STEP 3: RETURN CONFIRMATION**
    After completing Steps 1 and 2, return ONLY this confirmation (no summary):
    \`\`\`
    REPORT_CREATED: ${ARTIFACT_REPORTS}${TOPIC_NUMBER}_research_[TOPIC_NAME].md
    \`\`\`

    **CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS** (Non-Negotiable):
    - DO NOT return summary text. Orchestrator will read your report file.
    - DO NOT use relative paths or calculate paths yourself
    - DO NOT skip file creation - it is mandatory
    - DO NOT wait to create file - do it in STEP 1
    - Use Write tool with the EXACT path provided above
    - File MUST exist at specified path when you return
    - File MUST be in ${ARTIFACT_REPORTS} directory
  "
}
```

**VARIABLES TO REPLACE** (These are the ONLY parts you modify):
- `[TOPIC]`: Replace with topic name (e.g., "oauth_patterns")
- `[TOPIC_NAME]`: Replace with sanitized topic name matching [TOPIC] (e.g., "oauth_patterns")
- `[SPECIFIC RESEARCH FOCUS FOR THIS TOPIC]`: Replace with topic-specific research requirements
- `[Specific search pattern N]`: Replace with specific search/analysis steps for this topic

**AUTOMATIC SUBSTITUTION FROM PHASE 0** (DO NOT manually replace these):
- `${ARTIFACT_REPORTS}`: Absolute path to reports directory from location context
- `${TOPIC_NUMBER}`: 3-digit topic number from location context (e.g., "027")
- These variables are set in Phase 0 and available in workflow state

**ENFORCEMENT VERIFICATION**: After replacing variables, confirm:
- [ ] All enforcement markers preserved ("ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENT", "CRITICAL", "STEP 1", etc.)
- [ ] No language simplified or paraphrased
- [ ] Structure identical to template
- [ ] Only specified variables replaced

---

**MANDATORY: Parallel Invocation Pattern**

To achieve true parallel execution (60-70% time savings), YOU MUST invoke ALL research agents in a SINGLE message with multiple Task tool calls:

**CORRECT PATTERN** (Required):
```
Message to Claude Code:
I'm invoking 3 research agents in parallel:

Task { [agent 1 with EXACT template above] }
Task { [agent 2 with EXACT template above] }
Task { [agent 3 with EXACT template above] }
```

**INCORRECT PATTERN** (Do NOT do this):
```
Message 1: Task { [agent 1] }
[wait for response]
Message 2: Task { [agent 2] }
[wait for response]
Message 3: Task { [agent 3] }
```

**VERIFICATION BEFORE INVOCATION**:
- [ ] All agent prompts use EXACT template
- [ ] All REPORT_PATHS replaced with absolute paths
- [ ] All Task calls in SINGLE message
- [ ] No enforcement markers removed

<!--
ENFORCEMENT RATIONALE: Mandatory Verification + Fallback

WHY "MANDATORY VERIFICATION" instead of "Verify that":
- Descriptive "verify that" sounds advisory, Claude WILL skip
- ~20% of runs skip verification when not marked mandatory
- Without verification, missing files go undetected
- Without fallback trigger, 0% success when agent doesn't comply

WHY fallback mechanism is "GUARANTEED":
- Primary path: Agent creates file (60-80% success with exact template)
- Fallback path: Orchestrator creates file from agent output (100% success)
- Combined: 100% file creation rate

BEFORE: "Verify that files were created" (80% execution, 0% fallback)
AFTER: "**MANDATORY VERIFICATION**" + fallback (100% execution, 100% creation)
-->

**MANDATORY VERIFICATION - Report File Creation** (NON-OPTIONAL - Execute Immediately After Agents Complete)

**ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENT**: This verification step MUST execute after research agents complete. This is NOT optional debugging - it is a MANDATORY checkpoint that guarantees 100% file creation rate.

**WHY THIS MATTERS**: Without this verification, ~20-40% of research runs result in missing report files. This checkpoint + fallback mechanism guarantees ALL reports exist regardless of agent compliance.

**EXECUTE NOW - Parse and Verify Report Paths**:

```bash
# STEP 1: Extract REPORT_CREATED confirmations from agent outputs
declare -A AGENT_REPORT_PATHS

for topic in "${!REPORT_PATHS[@]}"; do
  AGENT_OUTPUT="${RESEARCH_AGENT_OUTPUTS[$topic]}"  # From Task tool results

**MANDATORY VERIFICATION CHECKLIST** (ALL must be ✓ before proceeding):

YOU MUST confirm ALL of these before moving to planning phase:

- [ ] Extracted REPORT_CREATED from each agent output (or noted absence)
- [ ] Checked file existence for EVERY expected report path
- [ ] Fallback report created for ANY missing file
- [ ] Verified fallback file exists (critical safety check)
- [ ] Path mismatch detection logged (if any occurred)
- [ ] Final count verification: ALL reports present
- [ ] NO missing reports (count = 0)
- [ ] Paths exported to RESEARCH_REPORT_PATHS

**CHECKPOINT REQUIREMENT**: Report verification completion:
```
CHECKPOINT: Report verification complete
- Reports expected: ${#REPORT_PATHS[@]}
- Reports verified: ${#AGENT_REPORT_PATHS[@]}
- Fallback creations: [count]
- All reports exist: ✓
- File creation rate: 100%
- Proceeding to: Metadata extraction
```

**CRITICAL SUCCESS CRITERION**: File creation rate MUST be 100%. If ANY report is missing after fallback, the orchestration MUST NOT proceed.

---

**EXECUTE NOW - Synthesize Individual Reports into Overview** (Phase 2: Research Synthesis)

After all individual reports are verified, invoke research-synthesizer to create overview report aggregating findings.

**WHY THIS MATTERS**: Overview report provides unified synthesis of all research findings, enabling plan-architect to consume single coherent document instead of multiple individual reports. Reduces planning phase complexity and improves plan coherence.

**EXECUTE NOW - Invoke research-synthesizer Agent**:

```yaml
Task {
  subagent_type: "general-purpose"
  description: "Synthesize individual research reports into overview"
  timeout: 300000  # 5 minutes for synthesis
  prompt: |
    Read and follow the behavioral guidelines from:
    ${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}/.claude/agents/research-synthesizer.md

    You are acting as a Research Synthesizer Agent.

    OPERATION: Aggregate individual research reports into comprehensive overview

    Individual Report Paths:
    ${RESEARCH_REPORT_PATHS_FORMATTED}

    Overview Output Path (ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENT):
    ${ARTIFACT_REPORTS}${WORKFLOW_TOPIC_NUMBER}_research_overview.md

    Topic Information:
    - Topic Number: ${WORKFLOW_TOPIC_NUMBER}
    - Topic Name: ${WORKFLOW_TOPIC_NAME}
    - Reports Directory: ${ARTIFACT_REPORTS}

    Tasks:
    1. Read all ${#RESEARCH_REPORT_PATHS[@]} individual reports completely
    2. Extract key findings, recommendations, constraints from each
    3. Identify cross-report patterns and themes
    4. Synthesize into overview with 6 required sections:
       - Executive Summary (3-5 sentences)
       - Cross-Report Findings (patterns across reports)
       - Detailed Findings by Topic (one section per report with link)
       - Recommended Approach (synthesized strategy)
       - Constraints and Trade-offs
       - Individual Report References (navigation links)
    5. Create overview file at EXACT path above using Write tool
    6. Generate 100-word summary for context reduction
    7. Return confirmation with metadata

    Required output format:
    OVERVIEW_CREATED: [absolute path]

    OVERVIEW_SUMMARY:
    [100-word synthesis of all findings]

    METADATA:
    - Reports Synthesized: [N]
    - Cross-Report Patterns: [count]
    - Recommended Approach: [brief description]
    - Critical Constraints: [if any]

    CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
    - CREATE overview file at exact path above
    - INCLUDE cross-reference links to all individual reports
    - USE relative paths for links (reports in same directory)
    - RETURN 100-word summary (not full content)
    - DO NOT skip reading any individual reports
}
```

**MANDATORY VERIFICATION - Overview Report Created**

After research-synthesizer completes, YOU MUST verify overview was created.

```bash
# Extract overview path from agent output
OVERVIEW_OUTPUT="$SYNTHESIZER_AGENT_OUTPUT"
OVERVIEW_PATH=$(echo "$OVERVIEW_OUTPUT" | grep -oP 'OVERVIEW_CREATED:\s*\K/.+' | head -1)

if [ -z "$OVERVIEW_PATH" ]; then
  echo "⚠️  WARNING: Agent did not return OVERVIEW_CREATED confirmation"
  echo "Falling back to expected path"
  OVERVIEW_PATH="${ARTIFACT_REPORTS}${WORKFLOW_TOPIC_NUMBER}_research_overview.md"
fi

echo "✓ Overview path: $OVERVIEW_PATH"

# Verify file exists
if [ ! -f "$OVERVIEW_PATH" ]; then
  echo "❌ ERROR: Overview report not created at $OVERVIEW_PATH"
  echo "FALLBACK: Creating minimal overview template"

  cat > "$OVERVIEW_PATH" <<EOF
# Research Overview

## Metadata
- **Date**: $(date -u +%Y-%m-%d)
- **Agent**: research-synthesizer (fallback)
- **Topic Number**: ${WORKFLOW_TOPIC_NUMBER}
- **Individual Reports**: ${#RESEARCH_REPORT_PATHS[@]} reports

## Executive Summary
Research synthesis not completed by agent. Please review individual reports:

## Individual Report References
EOF

  # Add links to individual reports
  for report_path in "${RESEARCH_REPORT_PATHS[@]}"; do
    filename=$(basename "$report_path")
    echo "- [$filename](./$filename)" >> "$OVERVIEW_PATH"
  done

  if [ ! -f "$OVERVIEW_PATH" ]; then
    echo "❌ CRITICAL: Fallback overview creation failed"
    exit 1
  fi

  echo "✓ FALLBACK: Minimal overview created"
fi

echo "✓ VERIFIED: Overview report exists at $OVERVIEW_PATH"

# Extract 100-word summary from agent output
OVERVIEW_SUMMARY=$(echo "$OVERVIEW_OUTPUT" | sed -n '/OVERVIEW_SUMMARY:/,/METADATA:/p' | sed '1d;$d' | tr '\n' ' ')

if [ -z "$OVERVIEW_SUMMARY" ]; then
  echo "⚠️  WARNING: No summary provided by agent"
  OVERVIEW_SUMMARY="Research overview synthesized from ${#RESEARCH_REPORT_PATHS[@]} individual reports. See overview file for details."
fi

echo "✓ Overview summary extracted (${#OVERVIEW_SUMMARY} chars)"

# Store overview path for planning phase
export RESEARCH_OVERVIEW_PATH="$OVERVIEW_PATH"
export RESEARCH_OVERVIEW_SUMMARY="$OVERVIEW_SUMMARY"
```

**CHECKPOINT - Research Synthesis Complete**:
```
CHECKPOINT: Research synthesis complete
- Individual reports: ${#RESEARCH_REPORT_PATHS[@]}
- Overview created: ✓
- Overview path: $OVERVIEW_PATH
- Summary extracted: ✓
- Proceeding to: Planning phase with overview reference
```

---

**EXECUTE NOW - Extract Metadata from Research Reports** (After Verification Complete)

Now that ALL report files are guaranteed to exist (100% verified), extract metadata for context passing to planning phase.

**WHY THIS MATTERS**: Metadata extraction (title + 50-word summary) reduces context by 99% compared to passing full report content. This enables complex workflows to stay under 30% context usage.

**EXECUTE NOW - Metadata Extraction**:

```bash
# Source metadata extraction utilities
source "${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}/.claude/lib/metadata-extraction.sh"

# Extract metadata from each verified report
declare -A REPORT_METADATA

for topic in "${!AGENT_REPORT_PATHS[@]}"; do
  REPORT_PATH="${AGENT_REPORT_PATHS[$topic]}"

  echo "Extracting metadata from: $REPORT_PATH"

  # Extract title, summary, key findings (NOT full content)
  METADATA=$(extract_report_metadata "$REPORT_PATH")

  # Store metadata (lightweight reference, not full content)
  REPORT_METADATA["$topic"]="$METADATA"

  echo "  ✓ Metadata extracted for: $topic"
done

echo "✓ Metadata extracted from ${#REPORT_METADATA[@]} reports"
```

**METADATA STRUCTURE** (What gets passed to planning phase):

For each report, pass ONLY:
- Report path (absolute reference)
- Title (1 line)
- Summary (max 50 words)
- Key findings (3-5 bullet points, ~30 words total)

**DO NOT PASS**: Full report content (this bloats context)

**VERIFICATION**:
- [ ] Metadata extracted from all ${#AGENT_REPORT_PATHS[@]} reports
- [ ] Each metadata block < 100 words
- [ ] Total metadata size < 1000 words (vs ~5000+ for full content)
- [ ] Report paths included (planning phase will read full content if needed)

**CHECKPOINT REQUIREMENT**:
```
CHECKPOINT: Metadata extraction complete
- Reports processed: ${#AGENT_REPORT_PATHS[@]}
- Metadata extracted: ${#REPORT_METADATA[@]}
- Total metadata size: ~[N] words (99% reduction vs full content)
- Context usage: <10% (research phase complete)
- Proceeding to: Final research checkpoint
```

## Research Phase Complete

<!--
ENFORCEMENT RATIONALE: Checkpoint Reporting

WHY checkpoint reporting is mandatory:
- Provides clear progress indicators (user knows phase complete)
- Documents critical metrics (file creation rate, context usage)
- Creates audit trail (debugging failed workflows)
- Confirms all enforcement patterns executed

Without checkpoints:
- User unsure if phase complete
- No metrics for debugging
- Silent failures possible

BEFORE: No checkpoint (unclear status)
AFTER: Mandatory checkpoint (clear status, metrics, audit trail)
-->

**CHECKPOINT REQUIREMENT - Report Research Phase Completion**

Before proceeding to planning phase, YOU MUST report this checkpoint:

```

**CRITICAL**: This checkpoint is MANDATORY. Do NOT proceed to planning phase without reporting it.

**WHY THIS MATTERS**: Checkpoints provide:
1. Clear progress indicators for user
2. Verification that all critical steps executed
3. Metrics for debugging (file creation rate, context usage)
4. Audit trail for workflow execution

---

**Proceeding to Planning Phase**

After reporting the checkpoint, proceed to planning phase with:
- Report metadata (NOT full content)
- Workflow description
- Topic directory path

The planning phase will read full report content if needed.

---

### Planning Phase (Sequential Execution)

The planning phase synthesizes research findings into a structured implementation plan with clear phases, tasks, and testing requirements.

**When to Use Planning Phase**:
- **All workflows** require a plan (simple plans for simple tasks, detailed plans for complex features)
- Follows research phase (if research was performed) OR starts directly from user request
- Single plan-architect agent execution (not parallel)

**Quick Overview**:
1. Prepare planning context (research reports, user request, thinking mode, standards path)
2. Generate plan-architect agent prompt with all context
3. Invoke plan-architect agent (references plan-architect.md protocol)
4. Extract plan path from agent output and validate plan file
5. Save checkpoint with plan path and metadata
6. Display completion status and proceed to implementation

**Pattern Details**: See [Orchestration Patterns - Planning Phase](../templates/orchestration-patterns.md#planning-phase-sequential-execution) for:
- Complete context extraction procedure
- Planning agent prompt template with all placeholders
- Plan validation checklist and bash verification commands
- Checkpoint creation with plan metadata
- State management and TodoWrite updates
- Full workflow example with timing

**Key Execution Requirements**:

1. **Context Preparation** (Step 1):
   ```yaml
   Planning Context:
     research_reports: [array of paths] OR null  # From research phase
     workflow_description: "[original user request]"
     project_name: "[generated in research or from request]"
     thinking_mode: "[from research phase]" OR null
     claude_md_path: "/path/to/CLAUDE.md"

   Context Injection:
     - Provide report PATHS only (not summaries)
     - Agent uses Read tool to access reports selectively
     - Include thinking mode for consistency
     - No orchestration logic passed to agent
   ```

2. **Agent Invocation** (Step 3):
   - **SINGLE** Task tool invocation (sequential, not parallel)
   - Subagent type: general-purpose
   - Reference: plan-architect.md behavioral guidelines
   - Agent invokes /plan slash command
   - Wait for agent completion before proceeding

**EXECUTE NOW - Generate Implementation Plan**

YOU MUST invoke the /plan command to generate a structured implementation plan. This is NOT optional.

**WHY THIS MATTERS**: The planning phase is critical - it structures all research findings into actionable implementation steps. Skipping or simplifying this step leads to unstructured implementation and likely failure. A well-structured plan is the foundation for successful execution.

**MANDATORY INPUTS**:
- Workflow description (original user request)
- Research report paths (from Research Phase, if completed)
- Project standards file path (CLAUDE.md)
- Thinking mode (for consistency with research)

**EXECUTE NOW - Calculate Topic-Based Plan Path BEFORE Agent Invocation**

**WHY THIS MATTERS**: The plan must be created in the same topic directory as research reports for proper artifact organization. We use the location context from Phase 0 to guarantee correct location.

**VERIFICATION REQUIREMENT**: After executing this block, you MUST confirm PLAN_PATH is absolute and in topic-based structure.

```bash
# Use location context from Phase 0
echo "Planning phase starting..."
echo "Topic directory: $WORKFLOW_TOPIC_DIR"
echo "Topic number: $WORKFLOW_TOPIC_NUMBER"

# Calculate plan path using artifact paths from Phase 0 location context
# Format: ${ARTIFACT_PLANS}${TOPIC_NUMBER}_implementation.md
PLAN_PATH="${ARTIFACT_PLANS}${WORKFLOW_TOPIC_NUMBER}_implementation.md"

echo "Plan path calculated: $PLAN_PATH"

# Verify path is absolute
if [[ ! "$PLAN_PATH" =~ ^/ ]]; then
  echo "❌ CRITICAL ERROR: Plan path is not absolute: $PLAN_PATH"
  exit 1
fi

# Verify plan will be in correct artifact directory
if [[ "$PLAN_PATH" != "$ARTIFACT_PLANS"* ]]; then
  echo "❌ CRITICAL ERROR: Plan path not in artifact plans directory"
  echo "  Expected directory: $ARTIFACT_PLANS"
  echo "  Plan path: $PLAN_PATH"
  exit 1
fi

echo "✓ VERIFIED: Plan path is absolute and in artifact plans directory"
```

**CHECKPOINT - Path Pre-Calculation Complete**:
```
CHECKPOINT: Plan path calculated
- Topic directory: [WORKFLOW_TOPIC_DIR]
- Plan path: [PLAN_PATH]
- Path is absolute: ✓
- Topic-based structure: ✓
- Ready to invoke: plan-architect agent
```

**EXECUTE NOW - Invoke plan-architect Agent with Behavioral Injection**

**WHY THIS MATTERS**: We pass the pre-calculated PLAN_PATH to the agent so it creates the plan at the exact location we want, following topic-based organization.

**CRITICAL INSTRUCTION**: Use this EXACT template (no modifications):

```yaml
Task {
  subagent_type: "general-purpose"
  description: "Create implementation plan using plan-architect behavioral guidelines"
  timeout: 600000  # 10 minutes for planning
  prompt: "
    Read and follow behavioral guidelines from:
    ${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}/.claude/agents/plan-architect.md

    You are acting as a Plan Architect Agent.

    **Workflow Description**: ${WORKFLOW_DESCRIPTION}

    **Plan Output Path** (ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENT):
    ${PLAN_PATH}

    **Topic Information** (CRITICAL - From Phase 0 Location Context):
    - Topic Number: ${WORKFLOW_TOPIC_NUMBER}
    - Topic Path: ${WORKFLOW_TOPIC_DIR}
    - Topic Name: ${WORKFLOW_TOPIC_NAME}

    **Research Overview** (PRIMARY RESEARCH INPUT):
    - Overview Report Path: ${RESEARCH_OVERVIEW_PATH}
    - Overview Summary: ${RESEARCH_OVERVIEW_SUMMARY}

    **Individual Research Reports** (REFERENCE - Include in plan metadata):
    ${RESEARCH_REPORT_PATHS_FORMATTED}

    **Cross-Reference Requirements**:
    - In plan metadata, include \"Research Overview\" field with path: ${RESEARCH_OVERVIEW_PATH}
    - In plan metadata, include \"Research Reports\" section with ALL individual report paths above
    - In plan metadata, include \"Topic Number\" field with value: ${WORKFLOW_TOPIC_NUMBER}
    - In plan metadata, include \"Topic Path\" field with value: ${WORKFLOW_TOPIC_DIR}
    - PRIORITIZE overview report for planning (synthesized findings)
    - Reference individual reports for specific details if needed
    - This enables traceability from plan to research that informed it
    - Summary will later reference both plan and reports for complete audit trail

    **CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS**:
    1. CREATE plan file at EXACT path above using Write tool (not SlashCommand)
    2. READ research overview report at ${RESEARCH_OVERVIEW_PATH} for synthesized findings
    3. INCLUDE research overview in metadata \"Research Overview\" field with path
    4. INCLUDE all individual research reports in metadata \"Research Reports\" section
    5. INCLUDE topic number and path in metadata \"Topic Number\" and \"Topic Path\" fields
    6. FOLLOW topic-based artifact organization (path already calculated correctly)
    7. RETURN format: PLAN_CREATED: [path]

    **Expected Output Format**:
    PLAN_CREATED: [absolute path]

    Metadata:
    - Phases: [N]
    - Complexity: [Low|Medium|High]
    - Estimated Hours: [H]
  "
}
```

**CHECKPOINT - Agent Invocation Complete**:
```
CHECKPOINT: plan-architect agent invoked
- Agent type: general-purpose
- Behavioral file: plan-architect.md
- Plan path provided: ✓
- Research reports provided: ✓
- Awaiting: PLAN_CREATED response
```

3. **Plan Validation** (Step 4):
   ```bash
   Required Sections:
     - ## Metadata (Date, Feature, Scope, Standards, Research Reports)
     - ## Overview (Success criteria)
     - ## Implementation Phases (Numbered phases with tasks)
     - ## Testing Strategy

   Validation:
     - Plan file exists at extracted path
     - All required sections present
     - Tasks reference specific files
     - Research reports referenced (if research performed)
     - Max 1 retry if validation fails
   ```

**MANDATORY VERIFICATION - Plan File Created**

After plan-architect agent completes, YOU MUST verify the plan was created at the expected path.

**WHY THIS MATTERS**: We pre-calculated the plan path, so verification confirms the agent followed instructions and created the plan at the correct topic-based location.

**EXECUTE NOW - Verify Plan Creation**:

```bash
# STEP 1: Extract confirmation from agent output
# Expected format: "PLAN_CREATED: /absolute/path/to/plan.md"
PLAN_OUTPUT="$PLANNING_AGENT_OUTPUT"
PLAN_CREATED_PATH=$(echo "$PLAN_OUTPUT" | grep -oP 'PLAN_CREATED:\s*\K/.+' | head -1)

if [ -z "$PLAN_CREATED_PATH" ]; then
  echo "⚠️  WARNING: Agent did not return PLAN_CREATED confirmation"
  echo "Falling back to pre-calculated path: $PLAN_PATH"
  PLAN_CREATED_PATH="$PLAN_PATH"
fi

echo "✓ Plan creation path: $PLAN_CREATED_PATH"

# STEP 2: Verify paths match (agent created at expected location)
if [ "$PLAN_CREATED_PATH" != "$PLAN_PATH" ]; then
  echo "⚠️  WARNING: Path mismatch"
  echo "  Expected: $PLAN_PATH"
  echo "  Agent created: $PLAN_CREATED_PATH"
  echo "  Using agent's path (indicates path calculation issue)"
  PLAN_PATH="$PLAN_CREATED_PATH"
fi

# STEP 3: MANDATORY file existence check
echo "Verifying plan file exists at topic-based path..."

if [ ! -f "$PLAN_PATH" ]; then
  echo "❌ CRITICAL ERROR: Plan file not found at: $PLAN_PATH"
  echo "Agent may have failed to create plan using Write tool"
  exit 1
fi

echo "✓ VERIFIED: Plan file exists at topic-based path"

# STEP 4: Verify plan has required sections
REQUIRED_SECTIONS=("Metadata" "Overview" "Implementation Phases" "Testing Strategy")
MISSING_SECTIONS=()

for section in "${REQUIRED_SECTIONS[@]}"; do
  if ! grep -q "## $section" "$PLAN_PATH"; then
    MISSING_SECTIONS+=("$section")
  fi
done

if [ ${#MISSING_SECTIONS[@]} -gt 0 ]; then
  echo "⚠️  WARNING: Plan missing sections: ${MISSING_SECTIONS[*]}"
  echo "Plan may be incomplete, but continuing..."
fi

echo "✓ VERIFIED: Plan structure complete"

# STEP 5: Verify research overview and reports cross-referenced [Phase 2]
if [ -n "$RESEARCH_OVERVIEW_PATH" ]; then
  echo "Verifying plan references research overview..."

  # Check for Research Overview field in plan metadata
  if ! grep -q "## Metadata" "$PLAN_PATH"; then
    echo "⚠️  WARNING: Plan missing Metadata section"
  elif ! grep -A 30 "## Metadata" "$PLAN_PATH" | grep -q "Research Overview"; then
    echo "⚠️  WARNING: Plan missing 'Research Overview' in metadata"
    echo "⚠️  RECOMMENDATION: Reference overview report for traceability"
  else
    echo "✓ VERIFIED: Plan includes research overview cross-reference"
  fi

  # Verify overview report links to individual reports
  echo "Verifying overview report cross-references..."

  if ! grep -q "## Individual Report References" "$RESEARCH_OVERVIEW_PATH"; then
    echo "⚠️  WARNING: Overview missing 'Individual Report References' section"
    echo "⚠️  This section should link to all individual research reports"
  else
    # Count links in overview
    OVERVIEW_LINKS=$(grep -c "](\./" "$RESEARCH_OVERVIEW_PATH" || echo 0)
    INDIVIDUAL_REPORTS=${#RESEARCH_REPORT_PATHS[@]}

    if [ "$OVERVIEW_LINKS" -lt "$INDIVIDUAL_REPORTS" ]; then
      echo "⚠️  WARNING: Overview has $OVERVIEW_LINKS links but $INDIVIDUAL_REPORTS individual reports"
      echo "⚠️  Some individual reports may not be cross-referenced in overview"
    else
      echo "✓ VERIFIED: Overview includes links to individual reports ($OVERVIEW_LINKS links)"
    fi
  fi
fi

# Verify individual research reports cross-referenced
if [ -n "$RESEARCH_REPORT_PATHS_FORMATTED" ]; then
  echo "Verifying plan references individual research reports..."

  if ! grep -q "## Metadata" "$PLAN_PATH"; then
    echo "⚠️  WARNING: Plan missing Metadata section"
  elif ! grep -A 30 "## Metadata" "$PLAN_PATH" | grep -q "Research Reports"; then
    echo "⚠️  WARNING: Plan missing 'Research Reports' in metadata"
    echo "⚠️  RECOMMENDATION: Cross-reference research reports for traceability"
  else
    echo "✓ VERIFIED: Plan includes individual research reports cross-reference"
  fi
fi

# STEP 6: Extract metadata from agent output (context reduction)
PLAN_PHASE_COUNT=$(echo "$PLAN_OUTPUT" | grep -oP 'Phases:\s*\K\d+' | head -1)
PLAN_COMPLEXITY=$(echo "$PLAN_OUTPUT" | grep -oP 'Complexity:\s*\K\w+' | head -1)
PLAN_HOURS=$(echo "$PLAN_OUTPUT" | grep -oP 'Estimated Hours:\s*\K\d+' | head -1)

echo "✓ METADATA EXTRACTED (not full plan content):"
echo "  Phases: ${PLAN_PHASE_COUNT:-Unknown}"
echo "  Complexity: ${PLAN_COMPLEXITY:-Unknown}"
echo "  Hours: ${PLAN_HOURS:-Unknown}"
echo "✓ Context reduction achieved (metadata-only, not full plan)"

# Export for implementation phase
export IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN_PATH="$PLAN_PATH"
echo "✓ Exported: IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN_PATH=$PLAN_PATH"
```

**CHECKPOINT - Plan Verification Complete**:
```
CHECKPOINT: Plan created and verified
- Plan path: [PLAN_PATH]
- File exists: ✓
- Topic-based structure: ✓
- Required sections: ✓
- Research reports cross-referenced: ✓
- Metadata extracted: ✓
- Ready for: Implementation or summary phase
```

**CRITICAL**: If plan file verification fails, DO NOT proceed to implementation.

**Failure Handling**:

```bash
# If plan creation failed
if [ -z "$PLAN_PATH" ] || [ ! -f "$PLAN_PATH" ]; then
  echo ""
  echo "ERROR: Plan creation failed"
  echo "  Agent output: $PLANNING_AGENT_OUTPUT"
  echo "  Action: Review agent output for errors"
  echo "  Recommendation: Check research reports quality or retry planning"
  exit 1
fi
```

4. **Checkpoint and State** (Step 5):
   - Save checkpoint with: plan_path, plan_number, phase_count, complexity
   - Store ONLY plan path (not content) - agent reads file when needed
   - Update workflow_state.current_phase = "implementation"
   - Mark planning complete in completed_phases array

**Context Reduction**:
- **Research reports**: Pass paths (~50 chars each) instead of full content (~1000+ chars)
- **Plan output**: Store path (~50 chars) instead of full plan (~5000+ chars)
- **Total savings**: ~95-98% context reduction for subsequent phases

**Performance Metrics**:
- **Simple planning**: 1-2 minutes (direct implementation)
- **Medium planning**: 2-4 minutes (with research integration)
- **Complex planning**: 4-6 minutes (synthesis of multiple reports)

**Quick Example**:

```bash
# Step 1: Prepare context
RESEARCH_REPORTS=( \
  "specs/reports/existing_patterns/001_analysis.md" \
  "specs/reports/security_practices/001_practices.md" \
)
WORKFLOW_DESC="Add user authentication with email and password"
THINKING_MODE="think hard"

# Step 3: Invoke planning agent
# Task tool invocation with plan-architect.md reference
# Agent reads research reports, invokes /plan command

# Step 4: Extract and validate
PLAN_PATH="specs/plans/013_user_authentication.md"
# Verify plan exists, has required sections, references research

# Step 5: Save checkpoint
CHECKPOINT=".claude/checkpoints/orchestrate_user_authentication_20251013.json"
# Store: plan_path, plan_number=013, phase_count=4, complexity=Medium

# Step 6: Display completion
✓ Planning Phase Complete
Plan Created: specs/plans/013_user_authentication.md
Phases: 4, Complexity: Medium, Est. Hours: 12-15
Incorporating Research From: 2 reports
Planning Time: 2m 45s
→ Proceeding to Implementation Phase
```

## Planning Phase Complete

**CHECKPOINT REQUIREMENT - Report Planning Phase Completion**

Before proceeding to implementation phase, YOU MUST report this checkpoint:

```
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════
CHECKPOINT: Planning Phase Complete
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Phase Status: COMPLETE ✓

Planning Execution:
- Plan created: ✓
- Plan path: $IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN_PATH
- Planning agent invoked: ✓
- Planning time: [N] minutes

Plan Validation:
- File exists: ✓
- Required sections present: ✓
- Research reports referenced: ✓
- Plan structure verified: ✓

Plan Details:
- Phases defined: [N]
- Complexity score: [score]
- Estimated hours: [N-N]
- Research reports used: ${#RESEARCH_REPORT_PATHS[@]}

Next Phase: Implementation
- Will execute: code-writer agent with behavioral injection
- Will use: $IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN_PATH
- Expected: Automated phase-by-phase implementation with tests
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════
```

**CRITICAL**: This checkpoint is MANDATORY. Do NOT proceed to implementation phase without reporting it.

---

### Implementation Phase (Adaptive Execution)

The implementation phase executes the plan using code-writer agent with behavioral injection, runs tests after each phase, and conditionally enters debugging loop if tests fail.

**When to Use Implementation Phase**:
- **All workflows** that have a validated plan file
- Follows planning phase completion
- Single code-writer agent execution with behavioral injection
- Conditional debugging loop (max 3 iterations) if tests fail

**Quick Overview**:
1. Extract plan path and metadata from planning checkpoint
2. Build code-writer agent prompt with plan context
3. Invoke code-writer agent with behavioral injection (extended timeout)
4. Parse implementation results (test status, phases completed, files modified)
5. Evaluate test status → Success: proceed to docs OR Failure: enter debugging loop
6. Save checkpoint with implementation status
7. Display implementation status and transition decision

**Conditional Debugging Loop** (if tests fail):
1. Generate debug topic slug (first iteration only)
2. Invoke debug-specialist agent → creates report in debug/{topic}/NNN_report.md
3. Extract report path and recommended fixes
4. Apply fixes using code-writer agent
5. Run tests again → Pass: exit loop OR Fail: continue
6. Iteration control → Iteration < 3: retry OR Iteration ≥ 3: escalate to user

**Pattern Details**: See [Orchestration Patterns - Implementation Phase](../templates/orchestration-patterns.md#implementation-phase-adaptive-execution) for:
- Complete 7-step implementation execution procedure
- Complete 7-step debugging loop procedure
- Code-writer agent prompt template
- Debug-specialist agent prompt template
- Result parsing algorithms (regex patterns for status extraction)
- Checkpoint creation for implementation and debugging states
- Debugging iteration control and escalation logic
- Full workflow examples with debugging scenarios

**Key Execution Requirements**:

1. **Context Extraction** (Step 1):
   ```bash
   # Extract from planning checkpoint
   PLAN_PATH=$(jq -r '.workflow_state.plan_path' < checkpoint.json)
   PLAN_NUMBER=$(basename "$PLAN_PATH" | grep -oP '^\d+')
   PHASE_COUNT=$(grep -c "^### Phase" "$PLAN_PATH")
   COMPLEXITY=$(grep "^- \*\*Complexity\*\*:" "$PLAN_PATH" | cut -d: -f2 | tr -d ' ')
   ```

**EXECUTE NOW - Execute Implementation Plan**

YOU MUST invoke the code-writer agent DIRECTLY (NOT via /implement command) to execute the plan created in the planning phase. This is the core execution step.

**WHY THIS MATTERS**: This step performs the actual code changes. Without proper enforcement, the workflow stops at planning without implementation. The implementation phase is where plans become reality. Using behavioral injection ensures artifacts are created in the correct topic-based locations.

**MANDATORY INPUT**:
- Plan path from planning phase: $IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN_PATH
- Topic directory: $WORKFLOW_TOPIC_DIR
- Topic number: Extracted from plan path

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS**:
- YOU MUST use Task tool to invoke code-writer agent with behavioral injection
- YOU MUST pass plan path from planning phase
- YOU MUST inject artifact paths for debug/outputs/scripts
- DO NOT use SlashCommand tool or /implement command
- Timeout MUST be sufficient for multi-phase execution (600000ms minimum)

**CHECKPOINT BEFORE INVOCATION**:
```
CHECKPOINT: Implementation phase starting
- Plan path: $IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN_PATH
- Topic directory: $WORKFLOW_TOPIC_DIR
- Plan verified: ✓ (from planning phase)
- Invoking: code-writer agent with behavioral injection
```

2. **Agent Invocation** (Step 3):

**CRITICAL**: DO NOT use SlashCommand tool. Use Task tool with explicit Behavioral Injection Pattern.

```yaml
Task {
  subagent_type: "general-purpose"
  description: "Execute implementation plan with testing and progress tracking"
  timeout: 600000  # 10 minutes for complex implementations
  prompt: |
    Read and follow the behavioral guidelines from:
    ${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}/.claude/agents/code-writer.md

    You are acting as a Code Writer Agent for plan execution.

    IMPLEMENTATION PLAN:
    Read the complete implementation plan from:
    ${IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN_PATH}

    EXECUTION REQUIREMENTS:
    1. **Phase-by-Phase Execution**: Execute each phase sequentially
    2. **Task Completion**: Complete all tasks in each phase before proceeding
    3. **Testing After Each Phase**: Run test suite after completing each phase
    4. **Progress Updates**: Update plan file with task checkboxes [x] after completion
    5. **Git Commits**: Create git commit after each phase completion
    6. **Checkpoint Creation**: Save checkpoint if context window constrained

    ARTIFACT ORGANIZATION (CRITICAL):
    - **Debug Reports**: Save any debugging artifacts to ${WORKFLOW_TOPIC_DIR}/debug/
    - **Test Outputs**: Save test results to ${WORKFLOW_TOPIC_DIR}/outputs/
    - **Generated Scripts**: Save temporary scripts to ${WORKFLOW_TOPIC_DIR}/scripts/
    - **Plan Updates**: Update ${IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN_PATH} with progress markers

    TESTING PROTOCOL:
    - Discover test command from CLAUDE.md testing protocols
    - Run full test suite after each phase
    - If tests fail: Report failures and STOP (debugging phase will handle)
    - If tests pass: Continue to next phase

    GIT COMMIT FORMAT:
    After each phase completion, create commit with format:
    feat(${WORKFLOW_TOPIC_NUMBER}): complete Phase N - [Phase Name]

    Example: feat(027): complete Phase 2 - Backend Implementation

    PROGRESS REPORTING:
    Update plan file ${IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN_PATH} after each task/phase:
    - Mark completed tasks: - [x] Task description
    - Update phase status: **Status**: Completed
    - Preserve all formatting and metadata

    CHECKPOINT MANAGEMENT:
    If context window exceeds 80% capacity:
    1. Create checkpoint: .claude/data/checkpoints/${WORKFLOW_TOPIC_NUMBER}_phase_N.json
    2. Update plan with partial progress
    3. Return checkpoint path for resumption

    RETURN FORMAT:
    After implementation completes (or checkpoint created):

    IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS: [complete|partial|failed]
    TESTS_PASSING: [true|false]
    PHASES_COMPLETED: N
    FILES_MODIFIED: [list of file paths]
    COMMIT_HASHES: [list of git commit hashes]
    CHECKPOINT_PATH: [path if checkpoint created, else "none"]
    FAILURE_REASON: [if failed, brief description]

    If tests fail, include:
    FAILED_TESTS: [list of failed test names]
    TEST_OUTPUT_PATH: ${WORKFLOW_TOPIC_DIR}/outputs/test_failures.txt
}
```

**MANDATORY VERIFICATION - Implementation Status**

After code-writer agent completes, YOU MUST verify implementation status and test results. This verification is NOT optional.

**WHY THIS MATTERS**: Without status verification, determining implementation success or debugging needs is impossible. Test status determines whether to proceed to documentation or enter debugging loop.

**EXECUTE NOW - Extract and Verify Implementation Status**:

```bash
# STEP 1: Extract test status from code-writer agent output
# Expected format includes: "Tests passing: ✓" or "Tests passing: ✗"
IMPLEMENT_OUTPUT="[capture code-writer agent output]"

# Extract test status
TESTS_PASSING=$(echo "$IMPLEMENT_OUTPUT" | grep -oP 'Tests passing:\s*\K[✓✗]' | head -1)

if [ "$TESTS_PASSING" == "✓" ]; then
  echo "✓ VERIFIED: All tests passing"
  IMPLEMENTATION_SUCCESS=true
elif [ "$TESTS_PASSING" == "✗" ]; then
  echo "❌ TESTS FAILING"
  IMPLEMENTATION_SUCCESS=false
else
  echo "⚠️  WARNING: Could not determine test status from output"
  IMPLEMENTATION_SUCCESS=unknown
fi

# STEP 2: Extract phases completed
PHASES_COMPLETED=$(echo "$IMPLEMENT_OUTPUT" | grep -oP 'Phases completed:\s*\K\d+/\d+' | head -1)
echo "Phases completed: $PHASES_COMPLETED"

# STEP 3: Extract files modified
FILES_MODIFIED=$(echo "$IMPLEMENT_OUTPUT" | grep -oP 'Files modified:\s*\K\d+' | head -1)
echo "Files modified: $FILES_MODIFIED"

# STEP 4: Extract git commits
GIT_COMMITS=$(echo "$IMPLEMENT_OUTPUT" | grep -oP 'Git commits:\s*\K\d+' | head -1)
echo "Git commits: $GIT_COMMITS"

# Export status for documentation phase
export IMPLEMENTATION_SUCCESS
export TESTS_PASSING
export PHASES_COMPLETED
export FILES_MODIFIED
export GIT_COMMITS
```

**MANDATORY VERIFICATION CHECKLIST**:

YOU MUST confirm before proceeding to documentation:

- [ ] Test status extracted (passing or failing)
- [ ] Phases completed count extracted
- [ ] Files modified count extracted
- [ ] Git commits count extracted
- [ ] Implementation status exported

**CHECKPOINT REQUIREMENT**:
```
CHECKPOINT: Implementation phase complete
- Implementation status: $IMPLEMENTATION_SUCCESS
- Tests passing: $TESTS_PASSING
- Phases completed: $PHASES_COMPLETED
- Files modified: $FILES_MODIFIED
- Git commits: $GIT_COMMITS
- Proceeding to: Documentation phase (if tests passing) OR Debugging loop (if tests failing)
```

**CONDITIONAL LOGIC** (if tests failing):

If $IMPLEMENTATION_SUCCESS is false, trigger debugging loop (not part of this task).
For this orchestration, proceed to documentation phase regardless (document current state).

3. **Result Parsing** (Step 4 - Legacy Reference):
   ```python
   # Extract from agent output using regex (reference only)
   tests_passing = bool(re.search(r'TESTS_PASSING: true', output))
   phases = re.search(r'PHASES_COMPLETED: (\d+)/(\d+)', output)
   files = re.search(r'FILES_MODIFIED: \[(.*?)\]', output)
   commits = re.search(r'GIT_COMMITS: \[(.*?)\]', output)
   failed_phase = re.search(r'FAILED_PHASE: (\d+)', output)
   error_msg = re.search(r'ERROR_MESSAGE: (.+)', output)
   ```

4. **Decision Logic** (Step 5):
   ```yaml
   Evaluation Tree:
     tests_passing == true:
       → Proceed to Documentation Phase (Success Path)
     tests_passing == false:
       → Enter Debugging Loop (Failure Path)
         Loop Conditions:
           - Max 3 debugging iterations
           - Each iteration: debug report → fix → test
           - Exit on: tests pass OR max iterations reached
           - Escalate to user if max iterations exceeded
   ```

5. **Debugging Loop Requirements** (Conditional):
   - **Debug Topic Slug** (first iter only): Extract from error type (e.g., "test_timeout", "null_pointer")
   - **Debug Agent**: Invokes debug-specialist.md protocol
   - **Report Creation**: debug/{topic}/NNN_report.md (gitignored for issue tracking)
   - **Fix Application**: Code-writer applies recommended fixes
   - **Iteration Tracking**: workflow_state.debug_iteration (0-3)
   - **Escalation**: Present 3 debug reports to user, pause workflow

6. **Checkpoint Creation** (Step 6):
   ```yaml
   Implementation Success Checkpoint:
     status: "implementation_complete"
     tests_passing: true
     phases_completed: "N/N"
     files_modified: [array]
     git_commits: [array]
     next_phase: "documentation"

   Debugging Checkpoint (each iteration):
     status: "debugging_iteration_M"
     debug_iteration: M
     debug_topic: "{topic}"
     debug_reports: [array of M reports]
     tests_passing: false
     next_action: "retry" OR "escalate"
   ```

**Context Reduction**:
- **Plan reference**: Pass path (~50 chars) instead of full plan (~5000+ chars)
- **Implementation output**: Store status markers (~200 chars) instead of full output (~3000+ chars)
- **Debug reports**: Pass paths (~60 chars each) instead of full reports (~1500+ chars each)

**Performance Metrics**:
- **Implementation time**: 3-10 minutes per phase (depends on complexity)
- **Total implementation**: 15-60 minutes (4-8 phases typical)
- **Debug iteration**: 2-5 minutes per iteration
- **Max debugging time**: 15 minutes (3 iterations × 5 min)

**Quick Example - Success Path**:

```bash
# Step 1: Extract context
PLAN_PATH="specs/plans/013_user_authentication.md"
PHASE_COUNT=4
COMPLEXITY="Medium"

# Step 3: Invoke code-writer (timeout 600000ms)
# Agent executes plan: specs/plans/013_user_authentication.md
# Output after 25 minutes:
PROGRESS: Implementing Phase 1: Database schema...
PROGRESS: Running tests for Phase 1... ✓ All passing
PROGRESS: Creating git commit for Phase 1... ✓ e8f3a21
PROGRESS: Implementing Phase 2: Authentication API...
PROGRESS: Running tests for Phase 2... ✓ All passing
...
PROGRESS: All phases complete - 4/4 phases

# Step 4: Parse results
TESTS_PASSING: true
PHASES_COMPLETED: 4/4
FILES_MODIFIED: [users.lua, auth.lua, session.lua, tests/auth_spec.lua]
GIT_COMMITS: [e8f3a21, a3f9b10, c7e2d43, f1a8c91]
IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS: success

# Step 5: Evaluate → tests_passing == true
→ Proceed to Documentation Phase

# Step 6: Save checkpoint (implementation_complete)
```

**Quick Example - Debugging Path**:

```bash
# Step 1-3: Same as success path
# Step 4: Parse results after Phase 2
TESTS_PASSING: false
PHASES_COMPLETED: 2/4
FAILED_PHASE: 2
ERROR_MESSAGE: auth_spec.lua:42 - Expected 200, got 401

# Step 5: Evaluate → tests_passing == false
→ Enter Debugging Loop

# Debugging Iteration 1:
#   Step 1: Generate topic slug = "auth_status_code"
#   Step 2: Invoke debug-specialist
#   Output: debug/auth_status_code/001_session_cookie.md
#   Step 3: Extract: "Check session cookie initialization"
#   Step 4: Apply fix (code-writer modifies session.lua)
#   Step 5: Run tests → TESTS_PASSING: true
#   Step 6: Iteration control → tests pass, exit loop

# Step 6: Save checkpoint (debugging_resolved, iteration_count=1)
# Step 7: Display success with debugging note
→ Proceed to Documentation Phase (resolved after 1 debug iteration)
```

**Quick Example - Escalation Path**:

```bash
# Debugging Iteration 1: Tests still fail
# Debugging Iteration 2: Tests still fail
# Debugging Iteration 3: Tests still fail

# Step 6: Iteration control → debug_iteration=3 AND tests_passing=false
→ Escalate to user

# Display:

## Implementation Phase Complete

**CHECKPOINT REQUIREMENT - Report Implementation Phase Completion**

Before proceeding to documentation phase, YOU MUST report this checkpoint:

```
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════
CHECKPOINT: Implementation Phase Complete
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Phase Status: COMPLETE ✓

Implementation Execution:
- Plan executed: $IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN_PATH
- code-writer agent invoked with behavioral injection: ✓
- Implementation time: [N] minutes

Implementation Results:
- Tests passing: $TESTS_PASSING

```

**CRITICAL**: This checkpoint is MANDATORY. Do NOT proceed to documentation phase without reporting it.

---

### Documentation Phase (Sequential Execution)

This phase completes the workflow by updating project documentation, generating a comprehensive workflow summary with performance metrics, establishing bidirectional cross-references between all artifacts, and optionally creating a pull request.

#### Step 1: Prepare Documentation Context

GATHER workflow artifacts and build documentation context structure for the doc-writer agent.

**EXECUTE NOW: Gather Workflow Artifacts**

EXTRACT the following from workflow_state and prior phase checkpoints:

1. **Research report paths** (from research phase checkpoint, if completed)
2. **Implementation plan path** (from planning phase checkpoint)
3. **Implementation status** (from implementation phase checkpoint)
4. **Debug report paths** (from debugging phase checkpoint, if occurred)
5. **Modified files list** (from implementation agent output)
6. **Test results** (passing or fixed_after_debugging)

BUILD the documentation context structure:

```yaml
documentation_context:
  # From workflow initialization
  workflow_description: "[Original user request]"
  workflow_type: "feature|refactor|debug|investigation"
  project_name: "[generated project name]"

  # From research phase (if completed)
  research_reports: [
    "specs/reports/existing_patterns/001_report.md",
    "specs/reports/security_practices/001_report.md"
  ]
  research_topics: ["existing_patterns", "security_practices"]

  # From planning phase
  plan_path: "specs/plans/NNN_feature_name.md"
  plan_number: NNN
  phase_count: N

  # From implementation phase
  implementation_status:
    tests_passing: true
    phases_completed: "N/N"
    files_modified: [
      "file1.ext",
      "file2.ext"
    ]
    git_commits: [
      "hash1",
      "hash2"
    ]

  # From debugging phase (if occurred)
  debug_reports: [
    "debug/phase1_failures/001_config_init.md"
  ]
  debug_iterations: N
  issues_resolved: [
    "Issue 1 description",
    "Issue 2 description"
  ]

  # Current phase
  current_phase: "documentation"
```

**VERIFICATION CHECKLIST**:
- [ ] workflow_description extracted from state
- [ ] All phase outputs collected (research, planning, implementation, debugging)
- [ ] File paths verified (all referenced files exist)
- [ ] Context structure complete

#### Step 2: Calculate Performance Metrics

CALCULATE workflow timing and performance metrics explicitly.

**EXECUTE NOW: Calculate Performance Metrics**

COMPUTE workflow performance using these explicit algorithms:

1. **Total Workflow Time**:
   ```
   total_time = current_timestamp - workflow_start_timestamp
   total_minutes = total_time / 60
   total_hours = total_minutes / 60
   formatted_duration = sprintf("%02d:%02d:%02d", hours, minutes, seconds)
   ```

2. **Phase Breakdown**:
   For each completed phase, calculate:
   ```
   phase_duration = phase_end_timestamp - phase_start_timestamp
   phase_minutes = phase_duration / 60
   ```

3. **Parallelization Metrics** (if research phase completed):
   ```
   parallel_agents = count(research_reports)
   estimated_sequential_time = parallel_agents × average_research_time
   actual_parallel_time = research_phase_duration
   time_saved = estimated_sequential_time - actual_parallel_time
   time_saved_percentage = (time_saved / estimated_sequential_time) × 100
   ```

4. **Error Recovery Metrics** (if debugging occurred):
   ```
   total_errors = count(debug_reports)
   auto_recovered = total_errors (if tests eventually passed)
   manual_interventions = 0 (if no user escalation)
   recovery_success_rate = (auto_recovered / total_errors) × 100
   ```

BUILD the performance data structure:

```yaml
performance_summary:
  # Time metrics
  total_workflow_time: "[HH:MM:SS format]"
  total_minutes: N

  # Phase breakdown
  phase_times:
    research: "[HH:MM:SS or 'Skipped']"
    planning: "[HH:MM:SS]"
    implementation: "[HH:MM:SS]"
    debugging: "[HH:MM:SS or 'Not needed']"
    documentation: "[current phase]"

  # Parallel execution metrics (if research completed)
  parallelization_metrics:
    parallel_research_agents: N
    estimated_sequential_time: "[minutes]"
    actual_parallel_time: "[minutes]"
    time_saved_estimate: "[N% saved vs sequential]"

  # Error recovery metrics (if debugging occurred)
  error_recovery:
    total_errors: N
    auto_recovered: N
    manual_interventions: N
    recovery_success_rate: "[N%]"
```

**VERIFICATION CHECKLIST**:
- [ ] All timestamps extracted from checkpoints
- [ ] Duration calculations correct (no negative times)
- [ ] Parallelization metrics calculated (if applicable)
- [ ] Error recovery metrics calculated (if debugging occurred)

#### Step 3: Invoke Doc-Writer Agent

INVOKE the doc-writer agent with complete inline prompt including workflow summary template and cross-reference instructions.

**EXECUTE NOW: Invoke Doc-Writer Agent**

USE the Task tool to invoke the doc-writer agent NOW.

Task tool invocation:

```yaml
subagent_type: general-purpose

description: "Update documentation and generate workflow summary using doc-writer protocol"

prompt: |
  Read and follow the behavioral guidelines from:
  /home/benjamin/.config/.claude/agents/doc-writer.md

  You are acting as a Documentation Writer Agent with the tools and constraints
  defined in that file.

  - Debugging Time: [debugging_phase_time or "Not needed"]
  - Parallelization Savings: [time_saved_percentage% or "N/A"]
  - Error Recovery Rate: [recovery_success_rate% or "100% (no errors)"]

  ### Documentation Requirements

  1. **Update Project Documentation**:
     - Review files modified during implementation
     - Update relevant README files
     - Add usage examples where appropriate
     - Ensure documentation follows CLAUDE.md standards

**EXECUTE NOW - Generate Workflow Summary**

YOU MUST create a comprehensive workflow summary documenting the entire orchestration. This is NOT optional.

**WHY THIS MATTERS**: The summary is the permanent record of what was accomplished. Without it, the orchestration workflow is undocumented and non-reproducible. The summary enables future reference, knowledge transfer, and workflow improvement.

**MANDATORY INPUTS**:
- Workflow description (original user request)
- Research report paths (from Research Phase, if completed)
- Implementation plan path (from Planning Phase)
- Implementation status (from Implementation Phase)
- All phase metrics (timing, file counts, etc.)

**EXECUTE NOW - Calculate Summary Path**:

```bash
# STEP 1: Calculate summary path (same directory as plan)
PLAN_DIR=$(dirname "$IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN_PATH")
PLAN_BASE=$(basename "$IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN_PATH" .md)
PLAN_NUM=$(echo "$PLAN_BASE" | grep -oP '^\d+')

# Summary goes in same topic directory, summaries/ subdirectory
SUMMARY_DIR="$(dirname "$PLAN_DIR")/summaries"
mkdir -p "$SUMMARY_DIR"

SUMMARY_PATH="$SUMMARY_DIR/${PLAN_NUM}_workflow_summary.md"

echo "Summary will be created at: $SUMMARY_PATH"
```

  2. **Create Workflow Summary**:
     Create a comprehensive workflow summary file at:
     `[plan_directory]/specs/summaries/[plan_number]_workflow_summary.md`

     **EXECUTE NOW - Create Summary File**:

     Use this exact template:

     ```markdown
     # Workflow Summary: [Feature/Task Name]

     ## Metadata
     - **Date Completed**: [YYYY-MM-DD]
     - **Specs Directory**: [specs_directory_path]
     - **Summary Number**: [NNN] (matches plan number)
     - **Workflow Type**: [feature|refactor|debug|investigation]
     - **Original Request**: [workflow_description]
     - **Total Duration**: [HH:MM:SS]

     ## Workflow Execution

     ### Phases Completed

     - [x] Planning (sequential) - [duration]
     - [x] Implementation (adaptive) - [duration]
     - [x] Debugging (conditional) - [duration or "Not needed"]
     - [x] Documentation (sequential) - [duration]

     ### Artifacts Generated

     **Research Reports**:
     [If research phase completed, list each report:]
     - [Report 1: path - brief description]
     - [Report 2: path - brief description]

     [If no research: "(No research phase - direct implementation)"]

     **Implementation Plan**:
     - Path: [plan_path]
     - Phases: [phase_count]
     - Complexity: [Low|Medium|High]
     - Link: [relative link to plan file]

     **Debug Reports**:
     [If debugging occurred, list each report:]
     - [Debug report 1: path - issue addressed]

     [If no debugging: "(No debugging needed - tests passed on first run)"]

     ## Implementation Overview

     ### Key Changes
     **Files Created**:
     [For each new file:]
     - [new_file.ext] - [brief purpose]

     **Files Modified**:
     [For each modified file:]
     - [modified_file.ext] - [changes made]

     **Files Deleted**:
     [For each deleted file:]

     ## Notes

     [Any additional context, caveats, or important information about this workflow]

     ---

     *Workflow orchestrated using /orchestrate command*
     *For questions or issues, refer to the implementation plan and research reports linked above.*
     ```

**MANDATORY VERIFICATION - Summary File Created**

After creating the summary file, YOU MUST verify it was created successfully. This verification is NOT optional.

**WHY THIS MATTERS**: The summary file is the permanent record of the workflow. If it's not created or is incomplete, the entire orchestration effort is undocumented.

**EXECUTE NOW - Verify Summary File**:

```bash
# STEP 1: Verify summary exists
if [ ! -f "$SUMMARY_PATH" ]; then
  echo "❌ CRITICAL ERROR: Summary file not created"
  echo "Expected path: $SUMMARY_PATH"
  exit 1
fi

echo "✓ VERIFIED: Summary file exists at $SUMMARY_PATH"

# STEP 2: Verify summary has required sections
REQUIRED_SECTIONS=("Metadata" "Workflow Execution" "Artifacts Generated" "Cross-References")
MISSING_SECTIONS=()

for section in "${REQUIRED_SECTIONS[@]}"; do
  if ! grep -q "## $section" "$SUMMARY_PATH"; then
    MISSING_SECTIONS+=("$section")
  fi
done

if [ ${#MISSING_SECTIONS[@]} -gt 0 ]; then
  echo "⚠️  WARNING: Summary missing sections: ${MISSING_SECTIONS[*]}"
  echo "Summary may be incomplete"
fi

echo "✓ VERIFIED: Summary structure complete"
```

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS**:
- YOU MUST create summary file (not optional)
- YOU MUST include all cross-references
- YOU MUST verify file created
- Summary MUST use the template structure

**CHECKPOINT REQUIREMENT**:
```
CHECKPOINT: Documentation phase complete
- Summary created: ✓
- Summary path: $SUMMARY_PATH
- Cross-references included: ✓
- All phases documented: ✓
- Proceeding to: Final workflow checkpoint
```

  3. **Create Cross-References**:

        ```markdown
        ## Implementation Summary
        This plan was executed on [YYYY-MM-DD]. See workflow summary:
        - [Summary path link]

        Status: ✅ COMPLETE
        - Duration: [HH:MM:SS]
        - Tests: All passing
        - Files modified: [N]
        ```

     b. **Update Research Reports** (if any):
        For each report in research_reports, add:
        ```markdown
        ## Implementation Reference
        Findings from this report were incorporated into:
        - [Plan path] - Implementation plan
        - [Summary path] - Workflow execution summary
        - Date: [YYYY-MM-DD]
        ```

     c. **Update Debug Reports** (if any):
        For each report in debug_reports, add:
        ```markdown
        ## Resolution Summary
        This issue was resolved during:
        - Workflow: [workflow_description]
        - Iteration: [N]
        - Summary: [Summary path link]
        ```

**EXECUTE NOW: Save Final Workflow Checkpoint**

USE checkpoint utility:
```bash
.claude/lib/save-checkpoint.sh orchestrate "$PROJECT_NAME" "$CHECKPOINT_DATA"
```

Where CHECKPOINT_DATA is:
```yaml
checkpoint_workflow_complete:
  # Phase identification
  phase_name: "documentation"
  completion_time: [current_timestamp]

  # Documentation outputs
  outputs:
    documentation_updated: [list of updated files]
    workflow_summary_created: "[summary_path]"
    cross_references_added: N
    status: "success"

  # Workflow completion
  next_phase: "complete"
  workflow_status: "success"

  # Complete workflow metrics
  final_metrics:
    # Time metrics
    total_workflow_time: "[HH:MM:SS]"
    total_minutes: N

    # Phase completion
    phases_completed: [
      "research",    # or "skipped"
      "planning",
      "implementation",
      "debugging",   # or "not_needed"
      "documentation"
    ]

    # Artifact counts
    artifacts_generated:
      research_reports: N
      implementation_plan: 1
      workflow_summary: 1
      debug_reports: N
      documentation_updates: N

    # File changes
    files_modified: N
    files_created: N
    files_deleted: N
    git_commits: N

    # Performance
    parallelization_savings: "[N% or 'N/A']"
    error_recovery_success: "[N% or '100% (no errors)']"

  # Complete workflow summary
  workflow_summary:
    research_reports: [list of paths]
    implementation_plan: "[plan_path]"
    workflow_summary: "[summary_path]"
    debug_reports: [list of paths]
    tests_passing: true
    documentation_complete: true
```

**Checkpoint File Location**:
```
.claude/data/checkpoints/orchestrate_${PROJECT_NAME}_${TIMESTAMP}.json
```

**VERIFICATION CHECKLIST**:
- [ ] Checkpoint saved successfully
- [ ] All workflow metrics included
- [ ] Artifact paths recorded
- [ ] Status set to "complete"

#### Step 7: Conditional PR Creation

EVALUATE whether to create a pull request and invoke github-specialist agent if required.

**EXECUTE NOW: Check for PR Creation Flag**

1. **Check for --create-pr Flag**:
   ```
   if "--create-pr" in original_command_arguments:
     pr_creation_required = true
   else:
     pr_creation_required = false
   ```

2. **Prerequisites Check** (if pr_creation_required):
   ```bash
   # Check if gh CLI is available and authenticated
   if ! command -v gh &>/dev/null; then
     echo "Note: gh CLI not installed. Skipping PR creation."
     echo "Install: brew install gh (or equivalent)"
     pr_creation_required = false
   fi

   if ! gh auth status &>/dev/null; then
     echo "Note: gh CLI not authenticated. Skipping PR creation."
     echo "Run: gh auth login"
     pr_creation_required = false
   fi
   ```

3. **Invoke github-specialist Agent** (if pr_creation_required):

   **EXECUTE NOW: Invoke GitHub Specialist Agent**

   USE the Task tool to invoke github-specialist agent NOW.

   Task tool invocation:
   ```yaml
   subagent_type: general-purpose

   description: "Create PR for completed workflow using github-specialist protocol"

   prompt: |
     Read and follow the behavioral guidelines from:
     /home/benjamin/.config/.claude/agents/github-specialist.md

     You are acting as a GitHub Specialist Agent with the tools and constraints
     defined in that file.

```

**Checkpoint Cleanup Logic**:
```yaml
if workflow_status == "success":
  → Delete checkpoint file (no longer needed)
  → Log completion to orchestrate.log

elif workflow_status == "escalated":
  → Keep checkpoint file (user may resume)
  → Move to .claude/data/checkpoints/failed/ for investigation

elif workflow_status == "error":
  → Keep checkpoint file (debugging needed)
  → Archive to .claude/data/checkpoints/failed/
```

```

#### Step 6: Create Summary File

**File Creation**:
```yaml
action: create_summary_file
location: "[plan_directory]/specs/summaries/NNN_workflow_summary.md"
content: "[Generated from template above]"
cross_references:
  - update_plan: add_summary_reference
  - update_reports: add_summary_reference
```

**Cross-Reference Updates**:
```markdown
Update related files to link back to summary:

In Implementation Plan (specs/plans/NNN_*.md):
Add at bottom:
## Implementation Summary
This plan was executed on [date]. See workflow summary:
- [Summary path and link]

In Research Reports (if any):
Add in relevant section:
### Implementation Reference
Findings from this report were incorporated into:
- [Plan path] - Implementation plan
- [Summary path] - Workflow execution summary
```

#### Step 7: Save Final Checkpoint

**Workflow Complete Checkpoint**:
```yaml
checkpoint_workflow_complete:
  phase_name: "documentation"
  completion_time: [timestamp]
  outputs:
    documentation_updated: [list of files]
    summary_created: "specs/summaries/NNN_*.md"
    cross_references: [count]
    status: "success"
  next_phase: "complete"

  final_metrics:
    total_workflow_time: "[duration]"
    phases_completed: [list]
    artifacts_generated: [count]
    files_modified: [count]
    error_recovery_success: "[%]"

  workflow_summary:
    research_reports: [list]
    implementation_plan: "[path]"
    workflow_summary: "[path]"
    tests_passing: true
```

#### Step 8: Create Pull Request (Optional)

**When to Create PR:**
- If `--create-pr` flag is provided, OR
- If project CLAUDE.md has GitHub Integration configured with auto-PR for branch pattern

**Prerequisites Check:**
Before invoking github-specialist agent:
```bash
# Check if gh CLI is available and authenticated
if ! command -v gh &>/dev/null; then
  echo "Note: gh CLI not installed. Skipping PR creation."
  echo "Install: brew install gh (or equivalent)"
  exit 0
fi

if ! gh auth status &>/dev/null; then
  echo "Note: gh CLI not authenticated. Skipping PR creation."
  echo "Run: gh auth login"
  exit 0
fi
```

**Invoke github-specialist Agent:**

Use Task tool with behavioral injection:

```yaml
Task {
  subagent_type: "general-purpose"
  description: "Create PR for completed workflow using github-specialist protocol"
  prompt: |
    Read and follow the behavioral guidelines from:
    /home/benjamin/.config/.claude/agents/github-specialist.md

    You are acting as a GitHub Specialist Agent with the tools and constraints
    defined in that file.

    Create Pull Request for Workflow:
    - Plan: [absolute path to implementation plan]
    - Branch: [current branch name from git]
    - Base: main (or master, detect from repo)
    - Summary: [absolute path to workflow summary]

    PR Description Should Include:
    - Workflow overview from summary file
    - Research phase: N reports generated with key findings
    - Implementation: All N phases completed successfully
    - Test results: All passing (or fixed after M debug iterations)
    - Documentation: N files updated
    - Performance metrics: Time saved via parallelization
    - File changes summary from git diff --stat

    Follow comprehensive PR template structure from github-specialist agent.
    This is a workflow PR, so include cross-references to all artifacts:
    - Research reports (if any)
    - Implementation plan
    - Workflow summary
    - Debug reports (if debugging occurred)

    Output: PR URL and number for user
}
```

**Capture PR URL:**
After agent completes:
- Extract PR URL from agent output
- Update workflow summary with PR link
- Update plan file Implementation Summary section with PR link

**Example Update to Summary:**
```markdown
## Pull Request
- **PR**: https://github.com/user/repo/pull/123
- **Created**: [YYYY-MM-DD]
- **Status**: Open
```

**Graceful Degradation:**
If PR creation fails:
- Log the error from agent
- Provide manual gh pr create command
- Continue without blocking (workflow is complete)
- Summary file still valid without PR link

**Example Manual Command:**
```bash
gh pr create \
  --title "feat: [feature name from workflow]" \
  --body "$(cat pr_description.txt)" \
  --base main
```

#### Step 9: Workflow Completion Message

**Final Output to User**:
```markdown
✅ Workflow Complete

**Duration**: [HH:MM:SS]

**Artifacts Generated**:
[If research]
- Research reports: N ([paths])
- Implementation plan: [path]
- Workflow summary: [path]
- Documentation updates: N files
[If PR created]
- Pull Request: [PR URL]

**Implementation Results**:
- Files modified: N
- Tests: ✓ All passing
[If debugging occurred]
- Issues resolved: N (after M debug iterations)

**Performance**:
- Time saved via parallelization: [N%]
- Error recovery: [N/M errors auto-recovered]

**Summary**: [summary_path]

Review the workflow summary for complete details, cross-references, and lessons learned.
```

#### Documentation Phase Example

```markdown
User Request: "Add user authentication with email and password"

Workflow Phases Completed:
✓ Research (3 parallel agents, 5min)
✓ Planning (created specs/plans/013_auth_implementation.md, 3min)
✓ Implementation (4 phases, all tests passing, 25min)
✓ Documentation (updated 3 files, created summary, 4min)

Total Duration: 37 minutes

Documentation Updated:
- nvim/README.md (added auth section)
- nvim/docs/ARCHITECTURE.md (added auth module diagram)
- nvim/lua/neotex/auth/README.md (created)

Workflow Summary Created:
- specs/summaries/013_auth_workflow_summary.md
- Cross-referenced: 2 research reports, 1 plan, 3 updated docs

Performance Metrics:
- Parallel research saved ~8 minutes (estimated)
- Zero errors, no debugging needed
- All cross-references verified

Checkpoint Saved: workflow_complete
Status: ✅ Success
```

## Orchestration Workflow Complete

**CHECKPOINT REQUIREMENT - Report Workflow Completion**

After documentation phase completes, YOU MUST report this final checkpoint:

```
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════
CHECKPOINT: Orchestration Workflow Complete
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Workflow Status: COMPLETE ✓

Workflow Summary:
- Original request: $WORKFLOW_DESCRIPTION
- Total duration: [calculated]
- Phases executed: 4 (Research, Planning, Implementation, Documentation)

Artifacts Created:
- Research reports: ${#RESEARCH_REPORT_PATHS[@]}
- Implementation plan: $IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN_PATH
- Implementation commits: $GIT_COMMITS
- Workflow summary: $SUMMARY_PATH

Implementation Results:
- Tests passing: $TESTS_PASSING
- Files modified: $FILES_MODIFIED
- Phases completed: $PHASES_COMPLETED
- Implementation success: $IMPLEMENTATION_SUCCESS

Performance Metrics:
- Research time: [duration]
- Planning time: [duration]
- Implementation time: [duration]
- Documentation time: [duration]
- Total workflow time: [duration]
- Parallel execution savings: ~60-70% (research phase)

Context Usage:
- Research phase: <10% (metadata only)
- Planning phase: <20%
- Implementation phase: variable
- Documentation phase: <10%
- Overall: <30% average

Next Steps:
- Review workflow summary: $SUMMARY_PATH
- Review implementation plan: $IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN_PATH
- Review research reports: ${#RESEARCH_REPORT_PATHS[@]} files
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════
```

**CRITICAL**: This checkpoint is MANDATORY. It marks the official completion of the orchestration workflow.

---

## Context Management Strategy

### Orchestrator Context (Minimal - <30% usage)

I maintain only:
- Current workflow state (phase, completion status)
- Checkpoint data (success/failure per phase)
- High-level summaries (research: 200 words max)
- File paths (not content): plan path, modified files, doc paths
- Error history: what failed, what recovery action taken
- Performance metrics: phase times, parallel effectiveness

### Subagent Context (Comprehensive)

Each subagent receives:
- Complete task description with clear objective
- Necessary context from prior phases (summaries only)
- Project standards reference (CLAUDE.md)
- Explicit success criteria
- Expected output format
- Error handling guidance

**No routing logic or orchestration details passed to subagents.**

### Context Passing Protocol

```markdown
For each subagent invocation:
1. Extract minimal necessary context from prior phases
2. Structure as focused task description
3. Remove all orchestration routing logic
4. Include explicit success criteria
5. Specify exact output format
```

## Error Recovery Mechanism

### Error Classification

**Error Types**:
1. **Timeout Errors**: Agent execution exceeds time limits
2. **Tool Access Errors**: Permission or availability issues
3. **Validation Failures**: Output doesn't meet criteria
4. **Test Failures**: Code tests fail (handled by Debugging Loop)
5. **Integration Errors**: Command invocation failures
6. **Context Overflow**: Orchestrator context approaches limits

### Automatic Recovery Strategies

See [Error Recovery Patterns](../docs/command-patterns.md#error-recovery-patterns) for detailed recovery strategies including:
- Automatic Retry with Backoff
- Error Classification and Routing (timeout, tool access, validation, integration)
- User Escalation Format

**Orchestrate-specific recovery**:
- Context Overflow Prevention: Compress context, summarize aggressively, reduce workflow scope
- Checkpoint-based recovery: Rollback to last successful phase
- Error history tracking: Learn from failures to improve future workflows

### Checkpoint Recovery System

See [Checkpoint Management Patterns](../docs/command-patterns.md#checkpoint-management-patterns) for checkpoint creation and restoration.

**Orchestrate-specific checkpoints**:
- Stored in orchestrator memory (minimal, ephemeral)
- Used for in-session recovery only
- Enable rollback to previous successful phase
- Preserve partial work on failures

### Manual Intervention Points

#### When to Escalate

**Automatic Escalation Triggers**:
1. **Max retries exceeded** (3 attempts for most error types)
2. **Critical failures** (data loss, security issues)
3. **Debugging loop limit** (3 debugging iterations)
4. **Context overflow** (compression limit reached)
5. **Architectural decisions** (user input required)

#### Escalation Format

See [User Escalation Format](../docs/command-patterns.md#pattern-user-escalation-format) for standard escalation message structure.

**User Options**:
- `continue`: Resume with manual fixes
- `retry [phase]`: Retry specific phase
- `rollback [phase]`: Return to checkpoint
- `terminate`: End workflow gracefully
- `debug`: Enter manual debugging mode

## Performance Monitoring

### Metrics Collection

Track throughout workflow:
- **Phase Execution Times**: Time per phase
- **Parallelization Effectiveness**: Actual vs potential time savings
- **Error Rates**: Failures per phase
- **Context Window Utilization**: Orchestrator context usage
- **Recovery Success**: Automatic vs manual interventions

### Optimization Recommendations

After workflow completion, suggest:
- Which phases could benefit from parallelization
- Bottleneck phases for optimization
- Checkpoint placement improvements
- Context management refinements

## Execution Flow

### Initial Workflow Processing

When invoked with `<workflow-description>`:

1. **Parse and Classify**:
   - Extract feature/task description
   - Determine workflow type
   - Identify complexity level
   - Check for parallel/sequential flags

2. **Initialize TodoWrite**:
   ```markdown
   Create todo list with identified phases:
   - [ ] Research phase (if needed)
   - [ ] Planning phase
   - [ ] Implementation phase
   - [ ] Debugging loop (conditional)
   - [ ] Documentation phase
   ```

3. **Execute Phases Sequentially**:
   - Research (parallel subagents) → synthesize
   - Planning (single subagent) → extract plan path
   - Implementation (single subagent) → check tests
   - Debugging (conditional loop) → ensure tests pass
   - Documentation (single subagent) → generate summary

4. **Update TodoWrite** after each phase completion

5. **Generate Final Summary**:
   - Workflow completion report
   - Performance metrics
   - Cross-references to all generated documents

## Notes

### Architecture Principles

**Supervisor Pattern** (LangChain 2025):
- Centralized coordination with minimal state
- Specialized subagents with focused tasks
- Context isolation prevents cross-contamination
- Forward message pattern avoids paraphrasing errors

**Context Preservation**:
- Orchestrator: <30% context usage (state, checkpoints, summaries only)
- Subagents: Comprehensive context for their specific task
- No routing logic passed to workers
- Structured handoffs with explicit success criteria

**Error Recovery**:
- Multi-level detection (timeout, tool access, validation)
- Automatic retry with adjusted parameters
- Checkpoint-based rollback and resume
- Graceful degradation to sequential execution

### When to Use /orchestrate

**Use /orchestrate for**:
- Complex multi-phase workflows (≥3 phases)
- Features requiring research + planning + implementation
- Tasks benefiting from parallel execution
- Workflows needing systematic error recovery

**Use individual commands for**:
- Simple single-phase tasks
- Direct implementation without planning
- Quick documentation updates
- Straightforward bug fixes

### Implementation Status

**Full implementation complete!** All phases have been implemented:

- [x] Phase 1: Foundation and Command Structure
- [x] Phase 2: Research Phase Coordination
- [x] Phase 3: Planning and Implementation Phase Integration
- [x] Phase 4: Error Recovery and Debugging Loop
- [x] Phase 5: Documentation Phase and Workflow Completion

The /orchestrate command provides comprehensive multi-agent workflow coordination with:
- Parallel research execution with context minimization
- Direct agent invocation via Behavioral Injection Pattern (plan-architect, code-writer, debug-specialist, doc-writer)
- Robust error recovery with automatic retry strategies
- Intelligent debugging loop with 3-iteration limit
- Complete documentation generation with cross-referencing
- Checkpoint-based recovery system
- Performance metrics tracking

Ready to orchestrate end-to-end development workflows!

## Agent Usage

This command uses specialized agents for each workflow phase:

### Research Phase
- **Agent**: `research-specialist` (multiple instances in parallel)
- **Purpose**: Codebase analysis, best practices research, alternative approaches
- **Tools**: Read, Grep, Glob, WebSearch, WebFetch
- **Invocation**: 2-4 parallel agents depending on workflow complexity

### Planning Phase
- **Agent**: `plan-architect`
- **Purpose**: Generate structured implementation plans from research findings
- **Tools**: Read, Write, Grep, Glob, WebSearch
- **Invocation**: Single agent, sequential execution

### Implementation Phase
- **Agent**: `code-writer`
- **Purpose**: Execute implementation plans phase by phase with testing
- **Tools**: Read, Write, Edit, Bash, TodoWrite
- **Invocation**: Single agent with extended timeout for complex implementations

### Debugging Loop (Conditional)
- **Investigation**: `debug-specialist`
  - Purpose: Root cause analysis and diagnostic reporting
  - Tools: Read, Bash, Grep, Glob, WebSearch
- **Fix Application**: `code-writer`
  - Purpose: Apply proposed fixes from debug reports
  - Tools: Read, Write, Edit, Bash, TodoWrite
- **Invocation**: Up to 3 debugging iterations before escalation

### Documentation Phase
- **Agent**: `doc-writer`
- **Purpose**: Update documentation and generate workflow summaries
- **Tools**: Read, Write, Edit, Grep, Glob
- **Invocation**: Single agent, sequential execution

#### Plan Hierarchy Update in Documentation Phase

After implementation completes successfully, update plan hierarchy to ensure all parent/grandparent plan files reflect completion status.

**When to Update**:
- After implementation phase completes (all tests passing)
- Before generating workflow summary
- For all expanded plan hierarchies (Level 1 and Level 2)

**Update Workflow**:

1. **Determine Plan Structure**:
   ```bash
   # Check if implementation created an expanded plan
   PLAN_PATH=$(get_plan_path_from_implementation_phase)
   STRUCTURE_LEVEL=$(detect_structure_level "$PLAN_PATH")
   ```

2. **Invoke Spec-Updater Agent** (if expanded):
   ```
   Task {
     subagent_type: "general-purpose"
     description: "Update plan hierarchy after workflow completion"
     prompt: |
       Read and follow the behavioral guidelines from:
       /home/benjamin/.config/.claude/agents/spec-updater.md

       You are acting as a Spec Updater Agent.

       Update plan hierarchy for completed workflow.

       Plan: ${PLAN_PATH}
       All phases have been completed successfully.

       Steps:
       1. Source checkbox utilities: source .claude/lib/checkbox-utils.sh
       2. Detect structure level: detect_structure_level "${PLAN_PATH}"
       3. For each completed phase: mark_phase_complete "${PLAN_PATH}" ${phase_num}
       4. Verify consistency: verify_checkbox_consistency "${PLAN_PATH}" (all phases)
       5. Report: List all files updated across hierarchy

       Expected output:
       - Confirmation of hierarchy update
       - List of all updated files (stage → phase → main plan)
       - Verification that all levels are synchronized
   }
   ```

3. **Validate Update Success**:
   - Check agent response for successful completion
   - Verify all hierarchy levels updated (if applicable)
   - Confirm no consistency errors reported

4. **Include in Workflow Summary**:
   Add hierarchy update confirmation to workflow summary:
   ```markdown
   ## Plan Hierarchy Status
   - Structure Level: [0|1|2]
   - All parent plans synchronized: [Yes|No]
   - Files updated: [list of plan files updated]
   ```

**Error Handling**:
- If hierarchy update fails: Log warning but continue with summary generation
- User notified in workflow summary that manual sync is required
- Link to checkbox-utils.sh for manual synchronization

**Skip Conditions**:
- Level 0 plans (single file) - no hierarchy to update
- Plans not using progressive expansion
- Implementation phase did not use code-writer agent with behavioral injection


### Agent Integration Benefits
- **Specialized Expertise**: Each agent optimized for its specific task
- **Tool Restrictions**: Security through limited tool access per agent
- **Parallel Execution**: Research-specialist agents run concurrently
- **Context Isolation**: Agents receive only relevant context for their phase
- **Clear Responsibilities**: No ambiguity about which agent handles what

## Checkpoint Detection and Resume

Before starting the workflow, YOU MUST check for existing checkpoints that might indicate an interrupted workflow.

### Step 1: Check for Existing Checkpoint

```bash
# Load most recent orchestrate checkpoint
CHECKPOINT=$(.claude/lib/load-checkpoint.sh orchestrate 2>/dev/null || echo "")
```

### Step 2: Interactive Resume Prompt (if checkpoint found)

If a checkpoint exists, YOU MUST present interactive options:

```
Found existing checkpoint for orchestrate workflow
Project: [project_name]
Created: [created_at] ([age] ago)
Progress: Phase [current_phase] of [total_phases] completed
Status: [status]

Options:
  (r)esume - Continue from Phase [current_phase + 1]
  (s)tart fresh - Delete checkpoint and restart workflow
  (v)iew details - Show checkpoint contents
  (d)elete - Remove checkpoint without starting

Choice [r/s/v/d]:
```

### Step 3: Resume Workflow State (if user chooses resume)

If user selects resume:
1. Load `workflow_state` from checkpoint
2. Restore `project_name`, `research_reports`, `completed_phases`
3. Skip to next incomplete phase
4. Continue workflow from that point

### Step 4: Save Checkpoints at Key Milestones

Throughout workflow execution, save checkpoints after each major phase:

```bash
# After research phase
.claude/lib/save-checkpoint.sh orchestrate "$PROJECT_NAME" "$WORKFLOW_STATE_JSON"

# After planning phase
.claude/lib/save-checkpoint.sh orchestrate "$PROJECT_NAME" "$UPDATED_STATE_JSON"

# After implementation phase
.claude/lib/save-checkpoint.sh orchestrate "$PROJECT_NAME" "$UPDATED_STATE_JSON"

# After debugging (if needed)
.claude/lib/save-checkpoint.sh orchestrate "$PROJECT_NAME" "$UPDATED_STATE_JSON"
```

### Step 5: Cleanup on Completion

On successful workflow completion:
```bash
# Delete checkpoint file
rm .claude/data/checkpoints/orchestrate_${PROJECT_NAME}_*.json
```

On workflow failure:
```bash
# Archive checkpoint to failed/ directory
mv .claude/data/checkpoints/orchestrate_${PROJECT_NAME}_*.json .claude/data/checkpoints/failed/
```
