plan:
  title: "{{feature_name}} Implementation"

  overview: |
    Implement {{feature_name}} with {{component_name}} as the main component.
    This plan follows project standards and includes comprehensive testing.

  phases:
    - name: "Planning and Design"
      complexity: "Medium"
      tasks:
        - "Review requirements for {{feature_name}}"
        - "Design {{component_name}} interface"
        - "Create architecture diagram"
        - "Identify dependencies"

    - name: "Core Implementation"
      complexity: "High"
      tasks:
        - "Implement {{component_name}} class"
        - "Add error handling"
        - "Write inline documentation"
        - "Follow project coding standards"

    - name: "Testing"
      complexity: "Medium"
      tasks:
        - "Write unit tests for {{component_name}}"
        - "Add integration tests"
        - "Test error cases"
        - "Verify >80% coverage"

    - name: "Documentation"
      complexity: "Low"
      tasks:
        - "Update README with {{feature_name}} usage"
        - "Add code examples"
        - "Document API endpoints"
        - "Update navigation links"

  success_criteria:
    - "{{component_name}} fully implemented and tested"
    - "All tests passing with >80% coverage"
    - "Documentation complete and accurate"
    - "Code follows project standards"

  spec_updater_checklist:
    - "Ensure plan is in topic-based directory structure (specs/{NNN_topic}/)"
    - "Create standard subdirectories if needed (reports/, debug/, scripts/, outputs/)"
    - "Update cross-references if artifacts moved during implementation"
    - "Create implementation summary in summaries/ when complete"
    - "Verify gitignore compliance (debug/ committed, others ignored)"

  estimated_hours: "{{estimated_hours}}"
