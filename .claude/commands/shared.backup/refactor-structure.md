# Refactoring Analysis Report Template

This template defines the standard structure for refactoring analysis reports created by the `/refactor` command.

## File Location

Refactoring reports are created in the topic-based directory structure:
```
specs/{NNN_topic}/reports/NNN_refactoring_scope.md
```

Where:
- `{NNN_topic}`: Three-digit numbered topic directory (e.g., `001_cleanup`)
- `NNN`: Next sequential number within the topic's `reports/` subdirectory
- `scope`: Snake_case description of refactoring scope (file, module, or area)

## Standard Refactoring Report Structure

- Project expected benefits

## Best Practices

### Analysis Approach
- Start with critical issues (bugs, security)
- Use automated tools when available (linters, complexity metrics)
- Apply CLAUDE.md standards systematically
- Consider user's specific concerns or new features
- Balance thoroughness with practicality

### Prioritization
- Critical issues always first
- Quick wins with high impact next
- Consider dependencies between refactorings
- Balance effort vs. benefit
- Risk assessment guides implementation order

### Solution Design
- Provide specific, actionable solutions
- Show code examples when helpful
- Consider multiple approaches for complex issues
- Explain trade-offs clearly
- Estimate effort realistically

### Communication
- Be objective and factual
- Explain "why" not just "what"
- Support claims with evidence
- Use concrete examples
- Avoid blame or judgment

## Output Pattern

When refactoring report is complete, use minimal output pattern:

```
âœ“ Refactoring Analysis Complete
Artifact: /absolute/path/to/specs/{topic}/reports/NNN_refactoring_scope.md
Summary: Found [N] critical issues, [M] high-priority opportunities, total effort: [X-Y hours]
```

See `.claude/templates/output-patterns.md` for complete output standards.

## Notes

- Refactoring reports are gitignored by default (part of specs/reports/ structure)
- Reports guide implementation plan creation via `/plan` command
- Implementation status updated when refactoring work begins/completes
- Cross-references maintained by spec-updater agent
- Metrics help prioritize and schedule refactoring work
- Migration path ensures safe application of refactorings
