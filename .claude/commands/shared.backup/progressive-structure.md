# Progressive Plan Structure

## Overview
Plans use progressive organization: Level 0 → Level 1 → Level 2.

## Level 0 (Single File)
All phases inline in one file. Suitable for simple plans (<5 phases).

## Level 1 (Phase Expansion)
Each phase in separate file. Used when complexity score >8 or >10 tasks per phase.

## Level 2 (Stage Expansion)
Individual stages expanded to separate files. For very complex phases requiring detailed specifications.

## Expansion Criteria
- **Complexity Threshold**: 8.0
- **Task Count Threshold**: 10
- **File Reference Threshold**: 10
