## Implementation Plans

- Instead of capturing workflow descriptions to /home/benjamin/.claude/tmp/, use .claude/data/workflow/
- When the implement subagent is used by coordinate, it is important that completed phases are marked with [COMPLETED] in their section headers, and for expanded plans, all parent plans are updated as well
- Fix coordinate plan errors
