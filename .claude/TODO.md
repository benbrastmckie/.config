# TODO

## Implementation Plans

- Instead of capturing workflow descriptions to /home/benjamin/.claude/tmp/, use .claude/data/workflow/
- When the implement subagent is used by coordinate, it is important that completed phases are marked with [COMPLETED] in their section headers, and for expanded plans, all parent plans are updated as well
- [ ] Fix the errors given in /home/benjamin/.config/.claude/specs/coordinate_output.md
- Test that the coordinate command supports implement only workflows
- Research and fix the coordinate command to avoid calling the implement command when running implementation as given in the console output /home/benjamin/.config/.claude/specs/coordinate_command.md
- [ ] Test that the coordinate command supports revision only workflows
- [ ] Avoid accidental implement /home/benjamin/.config/.claude/specs/coordinage_implement.md
- [ ] Coordinate should not be using the /plan command
