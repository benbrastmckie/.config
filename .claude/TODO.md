## Backlog

**Refactoring/Enhancement Ideas**:

- check relevant standards, updating as needed
- Retry semantic directory topic names and other fail-points
- Refactor subagent applications throughout commands
  - Incorporate skills throughout commands
- Make commands update TODO.md automatically
- Make all relevant commands update TODO.md
- Make metadata and summary outputs uniform across artifacts (include directory project numbers)
- /repair to check agreement with .claude/docs/ standards
- **Command optimization and consolidation** - Consolidate fragmented commands (/expand 32->8 blocks, /collapse 29->8 blocks), standardize "Block N" documentation, evaluate initialization patterns [Merged from Plan 882]
