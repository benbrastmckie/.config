> /supervise is running… I just ran /coordinate and got the output in /home/benjamin/.config/.claude/TODO.md instead of running
 research subagents as desired. carefully review this and other related shortcomings by comparing /supervise which works well,

● I'll analyze the /coordinate command to identify why it's not executing research subagents correctly, comparing it
  against the working /supervise command. Let me start by examining both commands and the TODO.md file you mentioned.

     # /coordinate Command Failure Analysis: Comparison with /supervise
     ## Metadata
     - **Date**: 2025-10-27
     - **Agent**: Claude (main orchestrator)
     - **Analysis Type**: Command architecture comparison
     - **Issue**: /coordinate outputting to TODO.md instead of invoking research subagents
     - **Baseline**: /supervise command (working correctly)
     ## Executive Summary

● I've completed a comprehensive analysis report comparing /coordinate with the working /supervise command. Here are the
  key findings:

  Critical Discovery: Meta-Level Failure

  The /coordinate command is not executing at all. Instead of the orchestrator command running, the assistant is treating
  your invocation as a normal user request and trying to help by:
  - Creating todo lists
  - Using Bash/Grep directly
  - Never invoking research subagents via the Task tool

  Root Cause Analysis

  Most Likely Cause: Missing or failing library - /coordinate requires dependency-analyzer.sh library (for wave-based
  execution) that /supervise doesn't need. If this library is missing or fails to load, the command exits immediately in
  Phase 0.

  Evidence:
  1. TODO.md shows normal assistant behavior, not orchestrator execution
  2. No bash library sourcing output visible
  3. No progress markers from Phase 0
  4. TodoWrite usage (orchestrator commands don't create workflow todos)
  5. Direct tool usage violates orchestrator role

  Key Differences Found

  1. Library Dependency: /coordinate requires dependency-analyzer.sh (for wave-based execution in Phase 3)
  2. Error Handling: /coordinate uses fail-fast vs /supervise's auto-recovery
  3. Context Pruning: /coordinate has explicit pruning calls throughout

  Immediate Actions

  The report includes a diagnostic command set to run:

  # Check if required library exists
  ls -la /home/benjamin/.config/.claude/lib/dependency-analyzer.sh

  # Validate bash syntax
  bash -n /home/benjamin/.config/.claude/commands/coordinate.md 2>&1 | head -20

  # Compare file sizes
  wc -l /home/benjamin/.config/.claude/commands/{coordinate,supervise}.md

  Recommendations

  1. Add library fallback (like /supervise has for workflow-detection.sh)
  2. Add debug output at the very start of Phase 0
  3. Verify function availability after library sourcing
  4. Test with minimal invocation to isolate the failure point

  The full analysis is available at:
  /home/benjamin/.config/.claude/specs/494_coordinate_command_failure_analysis/reports/001_coordinate_vs_supervise_analysis
  .md

  This is a 400+ line detailed report with:
  - Side-by-side behavioral comparison
  - Structural differences analysis
  - Diagnostic command set
  - Specific recommendations
  - Multiple appendices with technical details

  Would you like me to run the diagnostic commands to verify the root cause, or would you prefer to review the report
  first?
