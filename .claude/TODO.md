## Other

- when running the /research command, there are still fallbacks and the old style of reporting as seen below:
  - ● Bash(# MANDATORY VERIFICATION with fallback creation
        SUBTOPICS=(…)
    ⎿  Verifying report 1/3: ✓ (21KB)
       Verifying report 2/3: ✓ (23KB)
       Verifying report 3/3: ✓ (21KB)
       … +2 lines (ctrl+o to expand)
- once all plans in a specs/NNN_topic/ directory have been fully implemented, archive the NNN_topic/ directory by moving it to specs/archive/ which should be .gitignored to reduce clutter
