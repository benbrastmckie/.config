# TODO

## Current Functionality

The `/orchestrate` command provided in .claude/commands/ is working well to preserve context, but it is not creating artifacts as intended. Here is the output of a recent request:

### Example 1

```consol
> /orchestrate is running… I have recently conducted a major refactor on .claude/ and want all 
README.md docs to be complete, concise, and accurate with appropriate cross links. Carefully research 
what discrepancies remain or other improvements to the documentation can be made in order to plan and 
implement a complete documentation refactor for .claude/, ignoring the .claude/docs/ directory for 
now. 
  ⎿  Allowed 7 tools for this command

● I'll orchestrate a comprehensive documentation refactor workflow for .claude/ (excluding
  .claude/docs/).

● Starting Workflow: Documentation Refactor for .claude/

  Workflow Type: Documentation refactoring
  Complexity: Medium (research + planning + implementation)
  Approach: Parallel research → Sequential planning → Implementation → Summary

  ---
  Phase 1: Research Phase (Parallel Execution)

  I'll launch 4 parallel research agents to investigate:
  1. Current README structure and completeness
  2. Cross-linking accuracy and gaps
  3. Content accuracy vs actual implementation
  4. Documentation organization and consistency

● Task(Analyze README completeness)
  ⎿  Done (28 tool uses · 88.9k tokens · 1m 30s)                                                 

● Task(Audit cross-linking accuracy)
  ⎿  Done (28 tool uses · 95.4k tokens · 1m 20s)                                                 

● Task(Verify content accuracy)
  ⎿  Done (30 tool uses · 82.3k tokens · 1m 18s)                                                 

● Task(Assess organization consistency)
  ⎿  Done (11 tool uses · 88.8k tokens · 32.9s)                                                  

● Excellent! All 4 research agents have completed. Let me synthesize their findings:

● Research Summary (200 words)

  Coverage: 18 READMEs found covering all major subdirectories. One duplicate .claude/.claude/
  directory requires investigation.

  Critical Discrepancies:
  - Broken Links: 6 missing files referenced (template-system-guide.md, architecture.md,
  creating-commands.md, checkpoints/README.md, command-standards-flow.md)
  - Count Mismatches: Commands (claims 25, actual 21), lib files (claims 30, actual 58), shared
  docs (claims 9, actual 19)
  - Missing Documentation: Individual command files and agents lack detailed docs; wrapper files
  documented but don't exist (consolidated into bundles)
  - Cross-Linking Gaps: lib/README.md and templates/README.md missing parent links;
  commands/shared/README.md not linked from main

  Organization Issues:
  - Inconsistent section ordering and TOC depth across READMEs
  - Mixed navigation placement (top/bottom/both)
  - Varying styles (tutorial vs reference focus)
  - Missing standard sections (usage examples, related docs, quick reference)

  Recommended Approach:
  Implement 3-tier standardization: (1) Overview READMEs with navigation focus, (2) Domain READMEs
   with usage focus, (3) Infrastructure READMEs with reference focus. Fix broken links, update
  counts, add bidirectional cross-references, and standardize section ordering.

  Phase 2: Planning Phase

  Now I'll create a comprehensive implementation plan:

● Task(Create documentation refactor plan)
  ⎿  Done (21 tool uses · 93.1k tokens · 3m 14s)                                                                          

● Perfect! The plan is ready. Let me update the todo list and proceed to implementation:

● ---
  Phase 3: Implementation Phase

  Now I'll execute the implementation plan:

● Task(Execute documentation refactor plan)
  ⎿  Done (141 tool uses · 117.1k tokens · 12m 58s)                                                                       

● Excellent! Implementation phase completed successfully with all tests passing. Let me update the todo list and proceed to
   the final documentation phase:

  Phase 4: Documentation Phase

  Now I'll generate a comprehensive workflow summary:

● Read(.claude/specs/summaries/079_docs_refactor_summary.md)
  ⎿  Read 226 lines

● Perfect! The implementation already created a comprehensive summary. Now I'll create the final workflow summary that ties
   together all phases of the orchestration:

### Example 2

```consol
> /orchestrate is running… I see that the /orchestrate command is working well but still missing some key functionality. I 
provided an analysis of the last use of /orchestrate in /home/benjamin/.config/.claude/TODO.md including what functionality is 
missing. Carefully research the commands and agents in .claude/ in order to help me create a plan to further improve 
/orchestrate that integrates other elements that I may have missed but where there is infrastructure already in place to 
support. Refer to .cladue/docs/README.md and the associated files for further clarity about the goal as well as the README.md 
docs in .claude/ for the current implementation (which should be largely correct). Create a plan for me to review. 
  ⎿  Allowed 7 tools for this command

● I'll orchestrate a comprehensive research workflow to analyze the current /orchestrate implementation and identify
  improvements based on your TODO analysis and existing infrastructure.

● Starting Workflow: /orchestrate Enhancement Planning

  Workflow Type: Investigation and planning
  Approach: Parallel research → Synthesis → Planning

  ---
  Phase 1: Research Phase (Parallel Execution)

  I'll launch 4 parallel research agents to investigate:

  1. TODO Analysis: What specific gaps were identified in the last /orchestrate execution
  2. Current Implementation: How /orchestrate is currently structured and what it's missing
  3. Existing Infrastructure: What commands, agents, and utilities already exist that could be integrated
  4. Documentation Goals: What the docs say about the intended design vs current state

● Task(Analyze TODO.md for orchestrate gaps)
  ⎿  Done (1 tool use · 38.6k tokens · 13s)

● Excellent! All 4 research agents completed. Let me synthesize the findings:

● Research Summary (200 words)

  Critical Gaps from TODO.md:
  1. Artifact Organization: Research/planning subagents don't use correct specs/NNN_topic/ structure; missing location
  subagent
  2. Report Synthesis: Individual research reports lack aggregation/cross-referencing
  3. Complexity-Driven Expansion: Planning doesn't invoke complexity evaluator; no automated phase expansion
  4. Hierarchical Plan Structure: Expanded phases missing directory structure (NNN_plan_name/NNN_phase_name/)
  5. Wave-Based Implementation: No implementer subagent for parallel phase execution
  6. Progress Tracking: Missing reminders for plan updates and git commits per phase

  Current Implementation:
  7-phase sequential workflow (Research→Planning→Implementation→Debugging→Documentation→GitHub→Summary) with 6 integrated
  commands. Does well: pure orchestration, metadata passing (<30% context), parallel research (60-70% savings). Missing:
  workflow customization, multi-phase rollback, partial execution modes.

  Available but Unused Infrastructure:
  14 unintegrated commands (/plan-wizard, /plan-from-template, /refactor, /expand, /revise, /test-all), 15 unused agents
  (expansion-specialist, spec-updater, complexity-estimator, research-synthesizer, metrics-specialist), rich utility
  libraries (complexity-utils, parallel-orchestration, wave execution), 11 YAML templates.

  Design Vision vs Reality:
  Documentation emphasizes behavioral injection, recursive supervision (10+ agents), aggressive context pruning, dry-run
  validation. Current implementation lacks recursive delegation, robust file verification fallbacks, and metadata
  extraction discipline.

  Phase 2: Planning Phase

  Now I'll create a comprehensive improvement plan:

> /plan is running… "Enhance /orchestrate command to address 6 critical gaps from TODO.md: (1) artifact organization with

     … +1044 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

● Perfect! I've created a comprehensive implementation plan for enhancing the /orchestrate command. Here's what was
  delivered:

  Plan Summary

  Location: /home/benjamin/.config/.claude/specs/plans/080_orchestrate_enhancement.md
  Phases: 6 implementation phases
  Complexity: Medium-High overall
  Total Lines: 904 lines of detailed implementation guidance

  What the Plan Addresses

  All 6 Critical Gaps from TODO.md:

  1. Artifact Organization (Phase 1): location-specialist agent determines project directory and creates proper
  specs/NNN_topic/ structure
  2. Research Synthesis (Phase 2): research-synthesizer agent aggregates individual reports into overview with
  cross-references
  3. Complexity-Driven Expansion (Phase 3): complexity-estimator agent analyzes plans and recommends automated expansion
  4. Hierarchical Plan Structure (Phase 4): expansion-specialist creates proper directory structure (NNN_plan/phase_N.md,
  phase_N/stage_N.md) and updates parent plans
  5. Wave-Based Implementation (Phase 5): implementer-coordinator and implementation-executor agents enable parallel phase
  execution (40-60% time savings)
  6. Progress Tracking (Phase 6): Automated plan hierarchy updates, git commit generation, and spec-updater integration

  Integration of Unused Infrastructure

  15 New Agents Integrated:
  - location-specialist, research-synthesizer, complexity-estimator, expansion-specialist
  - implementer-coordinator, implementation-executor, spec-updater, checkpoint-manager
  - dependency-analyzer, metrics-collector, plan-validator, artifact-organizer
  - git-commit-helper, progress-reporter, context-pruner

  9 Commands Integrated (via behavioral injection):
  - /plan-wizard, /plan-from-template, /refactor, /expand, /collapse, /revise, /test-all, /list, /analyze

  Key Technical Decisions

  1. Behavioral Injection Pattern: Agents never invoke slash commands; commands pre-calculate paths and inject into prompts
  2. Metadata-Only Passing: 95-99% context reduction maintained (title + summary + path, not full content)
  3. Forward Message Pattern: Subagent responses passed directly without paraphrasing
  4. Recursive Supervision: Support for 10+ parallel agents via sub-supervisor pattern
  5. Maximum 2 Expansion Levels: L0 → L1 → L2 to prevent infinite recursion
  6. Context Budget: <30% target maintained across all phases

  Phase Breakdown

  Phase 1 (Foundation): location-specialist + artifact organization enforcement
  Phase 2 (Research Synthesis): research-synthesizer for overview report generation
  Phase 3 (Complexity Evaluation): complexity-estimator + automated plan analysis
  Phase 4 (Plan Expansion): expansion-specialist + hierarchical directory structure
  Phase 5 (Wave Implementation): Parallel execution with dependency-based wave coordination
  Phase 6 (Progress Tracking): Automated reminders, git commits, spec updates

  Testing Strategy

  - Unit tests for each new agent
  - Integration tests for complete workflow
  - Regression tests for existing functionality
  - Performance tests for parallelization gains
  - Validation tests for artifact organization

  Success Metrics

  - 100% artifacts in correct specs/NNN_topic/ structure
  - 100% multi-report workflows create overview
  - 95%+ accuracy in expansion recommendations
  - 40-60% time savings for parallelizable workflows
  - <30% context usage throughout
  - All 6 TODO.md gaps validated

  The plan is ready for your review. Would you like me to proceed with implementation, or would you like to discuss any
  aspects of the plan first?
```

### Shortcomings

- the research subagents did not create reports in a single directory for the project at hand
- the planning subagent did not create a plan in the correct artifact location indicated in "### Artifact Organization" in /home/benjamin/.config/.claude/docs/README.md
- the plan was not analyzed for potential expansion (if the plan does not need expansion, expansion can be skipped)
- the /orchestrate command should NEVER call the /plan command but rather should directly execute planning subagents
- more generally, no command should call other commands since instead they should execute subagents to conserve context

## Refactor Target

Below is a description of the intended additional functionality to be included in the `/orchestrate` command:

### Reference Directory

- create a location subagent to determine where the relevant project directory is where the specs/ directory should live for the task at hand in order to then create a new NNN_topic directory in the correct location, storing this location that can be returned to the primary agent to pass to all further subagents that are responsible for creating reports, plans, etc.
- require all research, planning, debugging, and summarizer agents to create files in the appropriate artifact location provided by the location subagent following the artifact organization provided in "### Artifact Organization" in /home/benjamin/.config/.claude/docs/README.md
- files that are created should be briefly summarized where that summary along with a reference path to the file created is passed back to the primary agent to display to the user and to pass to any further subagents that may need to make use of those resources
- a subagents should be called that can synthesize many reports in order to create a single overview report with appropriate references to the individual reports where the overview report is stored alongside the individual reports

### Planner

- the planning subagent should always begin by creating a single plan that includes complexity estimates for each phase and mark all dependencies between phases to facilitate wave implementation
  - the planning agent must be provided with a reference to the overview report for all of the reports created by the research subagents along with a clear prompt for what exactly the plan should aim to achieve
- once the plan is complete, the complexity evaluator subagent should be called in order to evaluate the plan complexity
  - bash scripts should not be used to evaluate plan complexity since there are no magic numbers or keywords
- if the plan warrants expansion, the expander subagent should be called to expand the plan appropriately into phase plans where each phase plan should include a complexity estimate
- after the initial plan has been expanded into phase files, the complexity evaluator subagent should be called to evaluate the plan complexity of the phase files
- if any of the phase files warrant further expansion, the expander subagent should be called to expand those phase files appropriately into stage files where each stage file includes a complexity estimate

### Expander

- whenever a phase/stage of a plan is expanded, a new phase/stage file should be created with a complexity estimate in the metadata as well as marking all dependencies on earlier phases
  - main plans that get expanded should be moved into directories with the appropriate name NNN_plan_name/ where the initial plan being expanded should live with all new phase plans that are created
  - similarly, phase plans that get expanded should be moved into directories with the appropriate name NNN_phase_name/ where the phase plan being expanded should live with all new stage plans that are created
  - See "### Artifact Organization" in /home/benjamin/.config/.claude/docs/README.md for organization
  - the phase/stage in the parent plan that is being expanded should then be replaced with a brief summary and a reference to the new phase/stage file that was created
- every phase/stage/part in any plan should conclude with a reminder that that file with progress made must be updated and also all plans above that plan in the structured plan hierarchy must be updated after creating a git commit for that phase/stage/part

### Implementer

- implementer subagent must be called by the primary agent to implement plans in waves (running independent dependency chains in parallel if possible), the most detailed plans (leaves in the plan hierarchy)
- the implementer agent must be provided with a reference to the top level plan to implement (if the plan is structured)
- the implementer subagents should always strive to implement plans in full (100/100)
- if the context window is ever running short, implementer subagents should create a checkpoint and update the plan being implemented along with all higher plans in the hierarchy to mark partial progress
- if a phase/stage/part is completed, then the plan being implemented should be updated to report progress made and update all higher plans in the hierarchy after creating a git commit
- brief progress updates should also be returned to the primary agent to monitor progress made
