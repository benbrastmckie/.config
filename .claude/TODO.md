  ⎿  Allowed 3 tools for this command

● I'll help you research whether display_brief_summary should be defined elsewhere and identify other functions that could
  be relocated from supervise.md for better organization. Let me start by decomposing this topic into focused research
  subtopics.

● Bash(source .claude/lib/topic-decomposition.sh && source .claude/lib/artifact-creation.sh && RESEARCH_TOPIC="should the
      display_brief_summary function be defined els…)
  ⎿  Calculated subtopic count: 4

● Now let me invoke the decomposition agent to break this into focused subtopics:

● Task(Decompose research topic into subtopics)
  ⎿  Done (7 tool uses · 80.1k tokens · 21.1s)                                                                            

● Excellent! Now let me parse these subtopics and calculate the report paths:

● Bash(source .claude/lib/unified-location-detection.sh && RESEARCH_TOPIC="should the display_brief_summary function be defined
       elsewhere (outside supervise.md?). revi…)
  ⎿  Error: /run/current-system/sw/bin/bash: eval: line 1: syntax error near unexpected token `perform_location_detection'

;
      exit 1 ; fi && echo '✓ VERIFIED: Topic directory created at ' && echo 'Topic name: ''

● Let me fix the quoting issue and try again with a simpler approach:

● Bash(source .claude/lib/unified-location-detection.sh && LOCATION_JSON=$(perform_location_detection
      "display_brief_summary_function_placement_analysis" "false") && e…)
  ⎿  Error: /run/current-system/sw/bin/bash: eval: line 1: syntax error near unexpected token `perform_location_detection'

     perform_location_detection display_brief_summary_function_placement_analysis false ) && echo '' < /dev/null | head -20'

● Let me try sourcing and executing separately:

● Bash(source .claude/lib/unified-location-detection.sh)
  ⎿  (No content)

● Bash(LOCATION_JSON=$(perform_location_detection "display_brief_summary_function_placement_analysis" "false") && echo
      "$LOCATION_JSON")
  ⎿  Error: /run/current-system/sw/bin/bash: line 1: perform_location_detection: command not found

● The library isn't being sourced properly in separate Bash invocations. Let me use the topic-utils library directly:

● Bash(source .claude/lib/topic-utils.sh && source .claude/lib/detect-project-dir.sh && PROJECT_ROOT="${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}" &&

● Perfect! Now let me create the research subdirectory and calculate report paths:

● Bash(TOPIC_PATH="/home/benjamin/.config/.claude/specs/477_display_brief_summary_function_placement_analysis" &&

  Research Complete! 🎯

  I've completed comprehensive hierarchical research on whether display_brief_summary should be moved outside supervise.md.
   Here are the findings:

  Main Answer: NO - Keep the function inline in supervise.md

  The research analyzed 65+ files across 4 focused subtopics and unanimously concludes that the current placement is
  correct.

  Key Findings

  1. Exemplary Architecture (Report 002)
  - supervise.md has only 1 inline function in 2,177 lines (0.05%)
  - 99.95% of functions are properly externalized to 7 libraries
  - This represents best-practice library-first design

  2. No Extraction Opportunity (Report 003)
  - display_brief_summary is workflow-specific (unique to /supervise)
  - References 7 command-specific variables
  - No reuse potential across other commands
  - Extracting would violate domain-specific library organization

  3. Standards Gap Identified (Report 001)
  - Command Architecture Standards lack guidance for small utility functions (10-50 lines)
  - Current practice follows "single command = inline" pattern
  - Function is correctly placed based on established patterns

  4. Non-Standard but Valid (Report 004)
  - Only 7% of commands use dedicated display functions
  - 93% use checkpoint-based completion
  - /supervise needs the function due to 4 workflow types × 4 invocation points

  Prioritized Recommendations

  Priority 1 (HIGH): ✅ Keep current architecture - NO CHANGES needed
  - Optionally add explanatory comment documenting why inline

  Priority 2-3 (MEDIUM): 📝 Document standards
  - Add Standard 13 (Utility Function Placement) to Command Architecture Standards
  - Add Standard 12 (Completion Output Patterns)

  Priority 4-5 (LOW): 📚 Create guides
  - Library design guide with extraction criteria
  - Consider extracting file verification pattern (appears in 10+ commands)

  Other Functions in supervise.md?

  All other functions are already correctly externalized! The 2025-10-14 refactor successfully moved all reusable logic to
  libraries. No additional inline functions require extraction.
