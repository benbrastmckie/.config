## Migration Note

This guide was split from a single 2,379-line file into 3 manageable files in November 2025. The original file has been preserved for reference as `coordinate-command-guide.md` but is deprecated.

**Total Lines**: 2,395 (split files) + 60 (index) = 2,455 lines
**Original File**: 2,379 lines
**Size Reduction**: All split files are <950 lines (Part 2: 908 lines, Part 1: 800 lines, Part 3: 687 lines)
