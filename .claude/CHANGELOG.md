All notable changes to the .claude/ system will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

## [Unreleased]

### Removed

- **Deprecated Commands** (2025-10-26): Archived 3 redundant/deprecated command files to `.claude/archive/commands/`:
  - `example-with-agent.md` - Template command for agent invocation (moved to documentation)
  - `migrate-specs.md` - One-time migration utility (migration completed)
  - `report.md` - Superseded by `/research` command with hierarchical multi-agent pattern

  **Migration**: Use `/research` instead of `/report` for all research tasks. All command references updated in orchestrate.md, plan.md, refactor.md, debug.md, implement.md, and README.md.

  **Impact**: Commands reduced from 23 to 20 files (12.5% reduction, ~33KB saved)

- **Deprecated Agent** (2025-10-26): Archived deprecated agent file to `.claude/archive/agents/`:
  - `location-specialist.md` - Superseded by unified location detection library (`.claude/lib/unified-location-detection.sh`)

  **Impact**: Agents reduced from 27 to 26 files (3.7% reduction, ~14KB saved)

- **Legacy Library Files** (2025-10-26): Archived legacy library files to `.claude/archive/lib/`:
  - `artifact-operations-legacy.sh` (84KB) - Superseded by modular artifact utilities
  - `migrate-specs-utils.sh` (17KB) - One-time migration completed, no longer needed

  **Function Migration**: Extracted `create_artifact_directory()` from artifact-operations-legacy.sh to artifact-registry.sh before archival. Updated auto-analysis-utils.sh to source artifact-registry.sh instead.

  **Impact**: Library files reduced from 67 to 65 files (3% reduction, ~101KB saved)

- **Compatibility Shims (utils/ directory)** (2025-10-26): Removed entire utils/ directory containing compatibility shims. All functionality available directly in lib/.
  - `utils/parse-adaptive-plan.sh` - Compatibility shim sourcing lib/plan-core-bundle.sh and lib/progressive-planning-utils.sh
  - `utils/show-agent-metrics.sh` - Utility script (archived, can be moved to scripts/ if needed)
  - `utils/README.md` - Directory documentation

  **Migration**: All code now sources lib/ directly. No active references to utils/ found in commands/, lib/, or tests/ (verified during Phase 1). Created unified codebase with single source of truth.

  **Function Mapping**:
  - All parse-adaptive-plan.sh functions → `lib/plan-core-bundle.sh` and `lib/progressive-planning-utils.sh`

  **Impact**: Directory removed, ~10KB saved, eliminated compatibility layer, improved maintainability

- **Examples Directory** (2025-10-26): Removed examples/ directory containing demonstration code only. All files archived to `.claude/archive/examples/`:
  - `artifact_creation_workflow.sh` - Demonstration of artifact utilities (not essential for operation)
  - `README.md` - Examples documentation

  **Impact**: Directory removed, ~10KB saved, cleaner directory structure

### Changed

- **Backup File Organization** (2025-10-26): Consolidated 30 backup files from scattered locations in specs/ to centralized location:
  - **New Location**: `.claude/data/backups/specs/`
  - **Files Moved**: All `*.md.backup*` files from specs/ subdirectories
  - **Impact**: Better organization, easier backup management

- **Directory Structure** (2025-10-26): Cleaned up .claude/ directory structure:
  - **Removed**: examples/, utils/
  - **Kept**: tts/ (user requested, active TTS notification system)
  - **Consolidated**: Backup files to data/backups/specs/
  - **Archived**: All removed files to archive/ subdirectories (reversible via git)

  **Total Space Saved**: ~266KB (commands: 33KB, agents: 14KB, libraries: 101KB, utils: 10KB, examples: 10KB)

### Fixed

- **System-wide Agent Delegation Anti-Pattern** (#002_report_creation): Fixed critical anti-pattern where agents were instructed to invoke slash commands instead of creating artifacts directly. This violated the behavioral injection pattern and prevented proper context management.

  **Affected Commands**:
  - `/orchestrate` (plan-architect agent → /plan command) - FIXED: plan-architect now creates plans directly at pre-calculated topic-based paths
  - `/implement` (code-writer agent → /implement recursion) - FIXED: removed all /implement invocation instructions from code-writer

  **Impact**:
  - 95% context reduction achieved in /orchestrate planning phase (168.9k → <30k tokens)
  - Zero recursion risk in /implement
  - Full control over artifact paths and metadata extraction
  - Consistent with /plan, /report, /debug reference implementations

  **Files Modified**:
  - `.claude/agents/plan-architect.md` (lines 64-88 removed)
  - `.claude/agents/code-writer.md` (lines 11, 29, 53 removed, Type A section removed)
  - `.claude/commands/orchestrate.md` (planning phase refactored, lines 1086-1150)

- **Artifact Organization Non-Compliance** (#002_report_creation): Enforced topic-based artifact organization standard across all commands. All artifacts now created in `specs/{NNN_topic}/reports/`, `specs/{NNN_topic}/plans/`, `specs/{NNN_topic}/summaries/`, etc. using `create_topic_artifact()` utility.

  **Problem**: Artifacts were scattered in flat structures (specs/reports/, specs/plans/) instead of centralized topic-based directories.

  **Solution**: All commands now use topic-based path calculation utilities, ensuring:
  - Centralized artifact discovery (all workflow artifacts in one topic directory)
  - Consistent numbering (same NNN prefix across all artifact types)
  - Clear lifecycle (gitignore policy varies by artifact type)
  - Easy cross-referencing (relative paths within topic)

- **Missing Cross-Reference Requirements** (#002_report_creation, Revision 3): Added requirements for plans to reference research reports and summaries to reference all workflow artifacts, enabling complete audit trails.

  **plan-architect agents**: Must include "Research Reports" metadata section
  **doc-writer agents (summarizers)**: Must include "Artifacts Generated" section

  **Files Modified**:
  - `.claude/agents/plan-architect.md` (cross-reference requirement added)
  - `.claude/agents/doc-writer.md` (cross-reference requirement clarified)
  - `.claude/commands/orchestrate.md` (agent invocations updated with cross-reference context)

### Added

- **Agent Loading Utilities** (#002_report_creation): Created `.claude/lib/agent-loading-utils.sh` with utilities for behavioral injection pattern:
  - `load_agent_behavioral_prompt(agent_name)` - Load agent prompt, strip YAML frontmatter
  - `get_next_artifact_number(artifact_dir)` - Calculate next NNN artifact number
  - `verify_artifact_or_recover(expected_path, topic_slug)` - Verify artifact with path recovery

- **Comprehensive Documentation** (#002_report_creation):
  - `.claude/docs/guides/agent-authoring-guide.md` - Complete guide for creating agent behavioral files (7 sections, anti-patterns, correct patterns, cross-reference requirements)
  - `.claude/docs/guides/command-authoring-guide.md` - Complete guide for commands invoking agents (8 sections, topic-based paths, Task tool templates)
  - `.claude/docs/troubleshooting/agent-delegation-issues.md` - Troubleshooting guide with 5 common issues (symptoms, diagnosis, solutions)
  - `.claude/docs/examples/behavioral-injection-workflow.md` - Complete workflow example
  - `.claude/docs/examples/correct-agent-invocation.md` - Task tool invocation examples
  - `.claude/docs/examples/reference-implementations.md` - Guide to /plan, /report, /debug reference implementations

  **Cross-Reference Network**: All documents link to each other, creating navigable knowledge base

- **Validation Tests** (#002_report_creation, Phase 1-4):
  - `.claude/tests/validate_no_agent_slash_commands.sh` - Anti-pattern detection for agent files
  - `.claude/tests/validate_command_behavioral_injection.sh` - Pattern compliance for commands
  - `.claude/tests/validate_topic_based_artifacts.sh` - Topic-based organization validation

  - `.claude/tests/test_agent_loading_utils.sh` - utility function tests (11 tests)
  - `.claude/tests/test_all_delegation_fixes.sh` - Master validation test runner

  **Coverage**: 100% agent files, 100% commands with agents, all artifact paths

- **End-to-End Integration Tests** (#002_report_creation, Phase 6):
  - `.claude/tests/test_e2e_orchestrate_workflow.sh` - Complete orchestrate workflow test (495 lines, 27 checks)

  **Coverage**: Cross-reference traceability, artifact organization, metadata extraction, parallel execution

- **Hierarchical Multi-Agent Research Pattern** (#002_report_creation, Phase 7):
  - `.claude/lib/topic-decomposition.sh` - Topic decomposition utility (85 lines, 3 functions):
    - `decompose_research_topic()` - Generate LLM prompt for subtopic decomposition (2-4 subtopics)
    - `validate_subtopic_name()` - Ensure snake_case format and length limits
    - `calculate_subtopic_count()` - Determine subtopics based on topic complexity
  - `.claude/agents/research-synthesizer.md` - Overview synthesis agent (536 lines, 30-point completion criteria)

### Changed

- **`.claude/docs/concepts/hierarchical_agents.md`** (#002_report_creation): Added "Agent Invocation Patterns" section documenting behavioral injection pattern, anti-patterns, correct patterns, utilities, cross-reference requirements, and reference implementations

- **`.claude/agents/code-writer.md`** (#002_report_creation): Removed /implement invocation instructions (lines 11, 29, 53) and "Type A: Plan-Based Implementation" section to eliminate recursion risk. Added explicit anti-pattern warning.

- **`.claude/agents/plan-architect.md`** (#002_report_creation): Removed SlashCommand(/plan) instructions (lines 64-88). Agent now creates plans directly at provided paths. Added cross-reference requirement for research reports in plan metadata.

- **`.claude/commands/orchestrate.md`** (#002_report_creation): Planning phase refactored (lines 1086-1150) to use behavioral injection with pre-calculated topic-based plan paths. Summary phase updated to pass all artifact paths for cross-referencing.

- **`.claude/commands/report.md`** (#002_report_creation, Phase 7): Complete refactor for hierarchical multi-agent research pattern (215 lines modified):
  - Added topic decomposition section (1.5): Decomposes topics into 2-4 focused subtopics using LLM analysis
  - Updated location determination (section 2): Pre-calculates absolute paths for all subtopic reports BEFORE agent invocation
  - Added parallel research-specialist invocation (section 3): Invokes all agents in single message with pre-calculated paths
  - Added report verification with error recovery (section 3.5): Validates all subtopic reports exist at expected paths
  - Added overview synthesis invocation (section 4): Invokes research-synthesizer agent to create OVERVIEW.md
  - Updated spec-updater integration (section 5): Handles hierarchical cross-references (overview ↔ subtopics ↔ plan)
  - Updated report structure documentation (sections 6-7): Documents individual subtopic reports and overview synthesis
  - Updated agent usage section: Documents complete hierarchical workflow with parallel execution benefits

- **`.claude/tests/run_all_tests.sh`** (#002_report_creation): Integrated new validation tests, component tests, E2E tests, and Phase 7 tests into test suite

### Deprecated

- **Agent Slash Command Invocation Pattern** (anti-pattern): Agent behavioral files instructing agents to invoke slash commands (e.g., "Use SlashCommand to invoke /plan") are now deprecated and flagged by automated validation.

- **Flat Artifact Structure** (anti-pattern): Creating artifacts in flat structures (specs/reports/, specs/plans/) instead of topic-based directories is now deprecated and flagged by validation.

- **Commands Delegating to Other Commands via Agents** (anti-pattern): Commands should invoke agents directly, not delegate to other commands via agents (e.g., orchestrate → plan-architect → /plan is wrong).

### Metrics

- **Context Reduction**: 95% reduction in /orchestrate planning phase (168.9k → <30k tokens)
- **Test Coverage**: 12 test files covering all fixes (unit, component, validation, integration)
- **Documentation**: 9 documents created/updated (guides, troubleshooting, examples, concepts)
- **Anti-Pattern Detection**: 100% agent files validated, 0 violations after fixes
- **Artifact Organization**: 100% topic-based compliance after fixes
- **Cross-Reference Coverage**: Plans reference all research reports, summaries reference all artifacts

### Migration Guide

**For Command Authors**:
1. Use `create_topic_artifact()` for all artifact paths (enforces topic-based organization)
2. Pre-calculate paths BEFORE agent invocation
3. Inject paths via prompt, not via slash commands
4. Extract metadata only (not full content) using `extract_report_metadata()`, `extract_plan_metadata()`
5. Include cross-references when required (plan-architect, doc-writer)
6. See [Command Authoring Guide](.claude/docs/guides/command-authoring-guide.md)

**For Agent Authors**:
1. NEVER use SlashCommand tool for artifact creation
2. ALWAYS create artifacts at exact paths provided by command
3. Return metadata only (path + summary + findings)
4. Use Write/Read/Edit tools for file operations
5. Include cross-references when required (plan-architect, doc-writer)
6. See [Agent Authoring Guide](.claude/docs/guides/agent-authoring-guide.md)

**For Troubleshooting**:
- See [Troubleshooting Guide](.claude/docs/troubleshooting/agent-delegation-issues.md)
- Run validation: `.claude/tests/validate_no_agent_slash_commands.sh`
- Check compliance: `.claude/tests/validate_topic_based_artifacts.sh`
