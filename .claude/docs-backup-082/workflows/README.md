## Quick Start

### Run Your First Orchestration
1. Review [Orchestration Guide](orchestration-guide.md) architecture section
2. Try basic orchestration: `/orchestrate "Research auth patterns and create plan"`
3. Use dry-run mode to preview: `/orchestrate "..." --dry-run`
4. Monitor parallel execution and artifact generation

### Set Up Adaptive Planning
1. Read [Adaptive Planning Guide](adaptive-planning-guide.md) structure levels
2. Create a simple plan with `/plan` (starts as L0)
3. Let complexity trigger auto-expansion to L1
4. Use `/expand` and `/collapse` to manage structure manually

### Enable Checkpoints
1. Study [Checkpoint Template Guide](checkpoint_template_guide.md) schema
2. Run a multi-phase workflow with `/implement`
3. Interrupt the workflow mid-execution
4. Resume with automatic checkpoint detection

### Convert Documents
1. Review [Conversion Guide](conversion-guide.md) quick start
2. Try simple conversion: `/convert-docs ./doc.md to pdf`
3. Convert directory: `/convert-docs ./docs`
4. Review conversion statistics and tool selection

## Workflow Patterns

### Pattern 1: Feature Development
```
/orchestrate "Implement authentication system" --parallel
  → Research phase (3 parallel agents)
  → Planning phase (template-based plan generation)
  → Implementation phase (adaptive planning with checkpoints)
  → Testing phase (automated test execution)
  → Documentation phase (doc generation + conversion)
```

### Pattern 2: Complex Refactoring
```
/plan-from-template refactoring "Modularize auth system"
  → Template generates L0 plan with checkpoint
  → /implement triggers expansion to L1 (complexity threshold)
  → Checkpoint enables multi-session work
  → Spec updater manages artifact organization
```

### Pattern 3: Documentation Project
```
/convert-docs ./research-docs ./final-docs
  → Batch convert DOCX/PDF to Markdown
  → Edit and enhance Markdown files
  → Convert back to DOCX/PDF for distribution
  → TTS notifications on completion
```

## Performance Optimization

**Parallel Execution**:
- Use `--parallel` flag in /orchestrate for 40-60% time savings
- Leverage phase dependencies for wave-based execution
- Review [Phase Dependencies](../reference/phase_dependencies.md) for syntax

**Context Efficiency**:
- Hierarchical agents achieve 92-97% context reduction
- Forward message pattern eliminates paraphrasing overhead
- Metadata-only passing reduces artifact references by 99%

**Template Acceleration**:
- Template-based planning is 60-80% faster than manual /plan
- Pre-configured patterns reduce decision overhead
- Integrated checkpoint creation eliminates setup steps
