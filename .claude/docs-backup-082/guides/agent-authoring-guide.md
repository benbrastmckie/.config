# Agent Authoring Guide

## Purpose

This guide provides comprehensive guidelines for creating agent behavioral files that follow the **behavioral injection pattern** - the correct architectural approach for command/agent interactions in the Claude Code system.

**Target Audience**: Developers creating new agent behavioral files or modifying existing ones.

**Related Documentation**:
- [Command Authoring Guide](command-authoring-guide.md) - How commands invoke agents
- [Hierarchical Agent Architecture](../concepts/hierarchical_agents.md) - Overall architecture
- [Troubleshooting Guide](../troubleshooting/agent-delegation-issues.md) - Common issues

## Section 1: Agent Behavioral Files Overview

### What Are Agent Behavioral Files?

Agent behavioral files (`.claude/agents/*.md`) define specialized agent behavior for specific tasks:
- **research-specialist.md**: Conducts codebase research and creates reports
- **plan-architect.md**: Creates implementation plans from requirements
- **code-writer.md**: Executes code changes from task specifications
- **debug-analyst.md**: Investigates bugs and creates debug reports
- **doc-writer.md**: Creates documentation and workflow summaries

### Agent Lifecycle

1. **Command invokes agent**: Primary command uses Task tool to invoke agent
2. **Agent receives context**: Command injects behavioral prompt + task-specific context
3. **Agent executes**: Agent uses Read/Write/Edit tools to complete task
4. **Agent returns metadata**: Path + summary + key findings (NOT full content)
5. **Command processes**: Command verifies artifact and extracts metadata

### Agent Responsibilities

**Agents SHOULD:**
- ‚úÖ Create artifacts directly using Write tool
- ‚úÖ Use Read/Edit tools to analyze and modify files
- ‚úÖ Use Grep/Glob tools for codebase discovery
- ‚úÖ Return structured metadata (path, summary, findings)
- ‚úÖ Follow topic-based artifact organization

**Agents SHOULD NOT:**
- ‚ùå Invoke slash commands (use SlashCommand tool for artifact creation)
- ‚ùå Make assumptions about artifact paths (use provided ARTIFACT_PATH)
- ‚ùå Return full artifact content (metadata only)
- ‚ùå Create artifacts outside topic-based structure

## Section 2: The Behavioral Injection Pattern

### Pattern Overview

The behavioral injection pattern separates concerns:
- **Commands**: Orchestration, path calculation, verification, metadata extraction
- **Agents**: Execution, artifact creation, analysis

### How It Works

```
1. Command Pre-Calculates Path
   ‚Üì
   source "${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}/.claude/lib/artifact-creation.sh"
   TOPIC_DIR=$(get_or_create_topic_dir "$FEATURE" "specs")
   ARTIFACT_PATH=$(create_topic_artifact "$TOPIC_DIR" "reports" "research" "")
   # Result: specs/042_feature/reports/042_research.md

2. Command Loads Agent Behavioral Prompt
   ‚Üì
   source "${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}/.claude/lib/agent-loading-utils.sh"
   AGENT_PROMPT=$(load_agent_behavioral_prompt "research-specialist")

3. Command Injects Complete Context
   ‚Üì
   Task {
     subagent_type: "general-purpose"
     prompt: |
       $AGENT_PROMPT

       **Task**: Research authentication patterns
       **Artifact Path**: $ARTIFACT_PATH
       **Success Criteria**: Create report at exact path
   }

4. Agent Creates Artifact
   ‚Üì
   (Agent uses Write tool to create file at ARTIFACT_PATH)

5. Command Verifies and Extracts Metadata
   ‚Üì
   VERIFIED=$(verify_artifact_or_recover "$ARTIFACT_PATH" "research")
   METADATA=$(extract_report_metadata "$VERIFIED")
```

### Why This Pattern?

**Benefits:**
- üìç **Path Control**: Commands control exact artifact locations
- üì¶ **Topic Organization**: All artifacts in topic-based structure
- üî¢ **Consistent Numbering**: Sequential NNN across artifact types
- üéØ **Context Reduction**: 95% reduction via metadata-only passing
- üö´ **No Recursion**: Agents never invoke commands that invoked them
- üèóÔ∏è **Architectural Consistency**: All commands follow same pattern

## Section 3: Anti-Patterns and Why They're Wrong

### Anti-Pattern 1: Agent Invokes Slash Command

**WRONG:**
```markdown
# plan-architect.md

## Step 1: Create Implementation Plan

**CRITICAL**: You MUST use the SlashCommand tool to invoke /plan:

SlashCommand {
  command: "/plan ${FEATURE_DESCRIPTION}"
}
```

**Why It's Wrong:**
- ‚ùå Loss of path control (can't pre-calculate artifact location)
- ‚ùå Cannot extract metadata before context bloat
- ‚ùå Breaks topic-based organization (slash command may use different structure)
- ‚ùå Violates separation of concerns (agent doing orchestration)
- ‚ùå Makes testing difficult (can't mock agent behavior)

**Impact:**
- Context bloat: 168.9k tokens (no reduction)
- Artifacts may be created in wrong locations
- Inconsistent numbering across workflows

### Anti-Pattern 2: Agent Invokes Command That Invoked It

**WRONG:**
```markdown
# code-writer.md

## Type A: Plan-Based Implementation

If you receive a plan file path, use /implement to execute it:

SlashCommand {
  command: "/implement ${PLAN_PATH}"
}
```

**Why It's Wrong:**
- ‚ùå **Recursion risk**: /implement ‚Üí code-writer ‚Üí /implement ‚Üí ‚àû
- ‚ùå Infinite loops possible
- ‚ùå Agent misunderstanding its role (executor, not orchestrator)

**Impact:**
- Risk of infinite recursion
- Timeouts and failures
- Confused responsibility boundaries

### Anti-Pattern 3: Manual Path Construction

**WRONG:**
```markdown
# research-specialist.md

Create report at: specs/reports/${TOPIC}.md
```

**Why It's Wrong:**
- ‚ùå Breaks topic-based organization (flat structure)
- ‚ùå Inconsistent numbering (no NNN prefix)
- ‚ùå Difficult artifact discovery (scattered locations)
- ‚ùå Non-compliant with `.claude/docs/README.md` standards

**Impact:**
- Reports created in flat structure: `specs/reports/topic.md`
- Should be: `specs/042_topic/reports/042_topic.md`
- Loss of centralized artifact organization

## Section 4: Correct Patterns with Examples

### Pattern 1: Agent Creates Artifact at Provided Path

**CORRECT:**
```markdown
# plan-architect.md

## Step 1: Receive Task Context

You will receive:
- **Feature Description**: The feature to implement
- **Research Reports**: Paths to research that informs the plan
- **Plan Output Path**: EXACT path where plan must be created

## Step 2: Create Implementation Plan

Use the Write tool to create the plan at the EXACT path provided:

Write {
  file_path: "${PLAN_PATH}"  # Use exact path from context
  content: |
    # ${FEATURE} Implementation Plan

    ## Metadata
    - **Research Reports**: (paths provided in context)

    ## Phases
    ...
}

## Step 3: Return Metadata

Return structured metadata:
{
  "path": "${PLAN_PATH}",
  "phase_count": N,
  "complexity_score": XX,
  "estimated_hours": YY
}
```

**Why It's Correct:**
- ‚úÖ Agent uses provided path (no assumptions)
- ‚úÖ Uses Write tool (not SlashCommand)
- ‚úÖ Returns metadata only (no full content)
- ‚úÖ Clear separation of concerns

### Pattern 2: Agent Uses Read/Write/Edit Tools

**CORRECT:**
```markdown
# code-writer.md

## Step 1: Receive Task List

You will receive specific code change TASKS (NOT plan file paths).

## Step 2: Execute Tasks

For each task:

1. Read existing files (if modifying):
   Read { file_path: "/path/to/file.js" }

2. Make changes:
   Edit {
     file_path: "/path/to/file.js"
     old_string: "old code"
     new_string: "new code"
   }

3. Create new files (if needed):
   Write {
     file_path: "/path/to/new-file.js"
     content: "..."
   }

## CRITICAL: Tool Usage

**ALWAYS use:** Read, Write, Edit, Grep, Glob, Bash
**NEVER use:** SlashCommand (for /implement, /plan, /report, etc.)
```

**Why It's Correct:**
- ‚úÖ Uses appropriate tools for file operations
- ‚úÖ No slash command invocations
- ‚úÖ Clear role: execute tasks, not orchestrate workflows

### Pattern 3: Research Agent with Topic-Based Artifacts

**CORRECT:**
```markdown
# research-specialist.md

## Step 1: Receive Research Context

You will receive:
- **Research Focus**: Topic to research (patterns, best practices, alternatives)
- **Feature Description**: Context for research
- **Report Output Path**: EXACT topic-based path (specs/{NNN_topic}/reports/{NNN}_topic.md)

## Step 2: Conduct Research

Use Grep, Glob, Read tools to:
1. Search codebase for existing implementations
2. Identify relevant patterns and utilities
3. Research best practices
4. Document alternative approaches

## Step 3: Create Report at Exact Path

Write {
  file_path: "${REPORT_PATH}"  # Topic-based path from context
  content: |
    # ${TOPIC} Research Report

    ## Executive Summary
    (50-word summary)

    ## Findings
    ...

    ## Recommendations
    ...
}

## Step 4: Return Metadata

{
  "path": "${REPORT_PATH}",
  "summary": "50-word summary",
  "key_findings": ["finding 1", "finding 2"],
  "recommendations": ["rec 1", "rec 2"]
}
```

**Why It's Correct:**
- ‚úÖ Uses provided topic-based path
- ‚úÖ Metadata-only return (95% context reduction)
- ‚úÖ Clear research methodology
- ‚úÖ Structured output format

## Section 5: Tool Usage Guidelines

### Allowed Tools (for Agents)

#### File Operations
- **Read**: Read file contents for analysis
- **Write**: Create new files at provided paths
- **Edit**: Modify existing files with exact string replacement

#### Code Discovery
- **Grep**: Search file contents with regex patterns
- **Glob**: Find files matching glob patterns
- **WebSearch**: Research external documentation (when needed)

#### Execution
- **Bash**: Run commands for testing, validation, file operations

### Restricted Tools (for Agents)

#### SlashCommand Tool
- **NEVER** use SlashCommand for:
  - `/plan` - Plan creation is command's responsibility
  - `/report` - Report creation is direct (not via command)
  - `/implement` - Implementation orchestration is command's responsibility
  - `/debug` - Debug workflow is command's responsibility

**Exceptions** (when SlashCommand IS allowed):
- Agent needs to delegate to another specialized command (rare)
- Explicitly instructed in behavioral file (with clear rationale)
- Example: doc-writer invoking `/list reports` to discover artifacts

### Tool Selection Decision Tree

```
Need to create artifact?
  ‚Üì
  Is ARTIFACT_PATH provided in context?
    ‚Üì YES
    Use Write tool with exact path ‚úÖ
    ‚Üì NO
    ERROR: Agent should not assume paths ‚ùå

Need to modify existing file?
  ‚Üì
  Use Edit tool with old_string/new_string ‚úÖ

Need to search codebase?
  ‚Üì
  Content search ‚Üí Grep ‚úÖ
  File search ‚Üí Glob ‚úÖ

Need to execute command?
  ‚Üì
  File operation (cp, mv, mkdir) ‚Üí Bash ‚úÖ
  Slash command (/plan, /implement) ‚Üí NEVER ‚ùå
```

## Section 6: Reference Implementations

### Example 1: research-specialist.md

**File**: `/home/benjamin/.config/.claude/agents/research-specialist.md`

**Pattern Used**: Topic-based artifact creation with metadata return

**Key Features:**
- Receives pre-calculated REPORT_PATH from command
- Uses Write tool to create report at exact path
- Returns metadata only (path + summary + findings)
- No slash command invocations

**Invocation Pattern** (from `/plan` command):
```markdown
Task {
  subagent_type: "general-purpose"
  prompt: |
    Read and follow behavioral guidelines from:
    /home/benjamin/.config/.claude/agents/research-specialist.md

    Research Focus: ${TOPIC}
    Feature: ${FEATURE_DESCRIPTION}
    Report Output Path: specs/042_feature/reports/042_research.md
}
```

**Why It's Correct:**
- Command pre-calculates topic-based path
- Command injects path into agent context
- Agent creates artifact at exact path
- Agent returns metadata only

### Example 2: debug-analyst.md

**File**: `/home/benjamin/.config/.claude/agents/debug-analyst.md`

**Pattern Used**: Parallel hypothesis investigation with artifact creation

**Key Features:**
- Receives hypothesis + ARTIFACT_PATH from command
- Investigates root cause using Grep/Read/Bash tools
- Creates debug report at topic-based path (specs/{NNN}/debug/{NNN}_investigation.md)
- Returns metadata with findings and proposed fixes

**Invocation Pattern** (from `/debug` command):
```markdown
Task {
  subagent_type: "general-purpose"
  prompt: |
    Read and follow behavioral guidelines from:
    /home/benjamin/.config/.claude/agents/debug-analyst.md

    Investigation Context:
    - Issue: ${ISSUE_DESCRIPTION}
    - Hypothesis: ${HYPOTHESIS}
    - Artifact Path: specs/027_bugfix/debug/027_investigation_${HYPOTHESIS}.md
}
```

**Why It's Correct:**
- Command generates hypotheses (orchestration)
- Command invokes multiple debug-analyst agents in parallel
- Each agent investigates one hypothesis independently
- Agents return metadata only (context reduction)

### Example 3: spec-updater.md

**File**: `/home/benjamin/.config/.claude/agents/spec-updater.md`

**Pattern Used**: Cross-reference management between artifacts

**Key Features:**
- Updates plan metadata with report references
- Updates report with plan references
- Validates bidirectional cross-references
- Used by /report, /plan commands after artifact creation

**Invocation Pattern** (from `/report` command):
```markdown
Task {
  subagent_type: "general-purpose"
  prompt: |
    Read and follow behavioral guidelines from:
    /home/benjamin/.config/.claude/agents/spec-updater.md

    Context:
    - Report created at: ${REPORT_PATH}
    - Topic directory: ${TOPIC_DIR}
    - Related plan (if exists): ${PLAN_PATH}
    - Operation: report_creation
}
```

**Why It's Correct:**
- Agent manages cross-references (specialized task)
- Agent receives artifact paths (no path calculation)
- Agent uses Edit tool to update metadata sections
- Agent returns cross-reference status (metadata)

## Section 7: Cross-Reference Requirements

### Plan-Architect Agent

**Requirement**: Plans MUST reference all research reports that informed them.

**Implementation**:
```markdown
# plan-architect.md

## Metadata Section

All plans must include a "Research Reports" section:

## Metadata
- **Date**: YYYY-MM-DD
- **Feature**: ${FEATURE_DESCRIPTION}
- **Research Reports**:
  - ${RESEARCH_REPORT_PATH_1}
  - ${RESEARCH_REPORT_PATH_2}
  - ...

This enables traceability from plan to research.
```

**Why It Matters:**
- Audit trail: Which research informed which plan decisions
- Discoverability: Easy to find related artifacts
- Validation: Ensures research phase completed before planning

### Doc-Writer Agent (Summarizer)

**Requirement**: Workflow summaries MUST reference all artifacts generated.

**Implementation**:
```markdown
# doc-writer.md

## Artifacts Generated Section

All workflow summaries must include:

## Artifacts Generated

### Research Reports
- ${RESEARCH_REPORT_PATH_1}
- ${RESEARCH_REPORT_PATH_2}
- ...

### Implementation Plan
- ${PLAN_PATH}

### Debug Reports (if applicable)
- ${DEBUG_REPORT_PATH_1}
- ...

This provides complete workflow audit trail.
```

**Why It Matters:**
- Complete workflow history
- Easy artifact discovery
- Enables workflow validation
- Supports /list-summaries command

### Cross-Reference Format

**Absolute Paths** (in command contexts):
```
/home/benjamin/.config/.claude/specs/042_auth/reports/042_security.md
```

**Relative Paths** (within same topic):
```
../reports/042_security.md  (from plans/ to reports/)
./042_implementation.md      (within same directory)
```

**Why Relative Paths Within Topics:**
- Topic directories may move
- Relative paths remain valid
- Easier to read and maintain

## Best Practices Summary

### DO:
- ‚úÖ Use provided ARTIFACT_PATH (no assumptions)
- ‚úÖ Create artifacts in topic-based structure
- ‚úÖ Return metadata only (path + summary + findings)
- ‚úÖ Use Read/Write/Edit tools for file operations
- ‚úÖ Include cross-references in metadata sections
- ‚úÖ Follow established patterns from reference implementations

### DON'T:
- ‚ùå Invoke slash commands for artifact creation
- ‚ùå Construct artifact paths manually
- ‚ùå Return full artifact content (context bloat)
- ‚ùå Create artifacts outside topic structure
- ‚ùå Invoke commands that invoked you (recursion)
- ‚ùå Make assumptions about project structure

### Testing Your Agent

1. **Unit Test**: Test agent in isolation with mocked inputs
2. **Integration Test**: Test agent invocation from command
3. **Anti-Pattern Check**: Scan for SlashCommand usage
4. **Metadata Validation**: Verify metadata-only return
5. **Path Compliance**: Verify topic-based artifact paths

## Troubleshooting

See [Agent Delegation Troubleshooting Guide](../troubleshooting/agent-delegation-issues.md) for:
- Agent invokes slash command instead of creating artifact
- Artifact not found at expected path
- Context reduction not achieved
- Recursion risk or infinite loops
- Artifacts not in topic-based directories
