- Historical context
- Understanding past design decisions
- Reference during troubleshooting
- Audit trail of system evolution

## Important Notice

**These documents are historical references. See main docs for current implementation.**

For current, up-to-date documentation, refer to the main documentation directory at [.claude/docs/README.md](../README.md).
