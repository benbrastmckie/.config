---

## Enhanced Workflow Phases

The enhanced orchestrator includes 7 phases (up from 5):

### 1. Research Phase (Parallel)
- **Purpose**: Investigate patterns, practices, alternatives
- **Agents**: 2-4 research-specialist agents
- **Execution**: Parallel (all agents invoked in single message)
- **Artifacts**: Research reports in `specs/reports/{topic}/`
- **Time Savings**: 60-80% vs sequential execution

### 2. Planning Phase (Sequential)
- **Purpose**: Synthesize research into implementation plan
- **Agent**: plan-architect
- **Execution**: Sequential (depends on all research complete)
- **Artifacts**: Implementation plan in `specs/plans/`
- **Output**: Level 0 plan (single file)

### 3. Complexity Evaluation Phase (Automated) *[NEW]*
- **Purpose**: Analyze plan phases for expansion needs
- **Agent**: complexity-estimator (with threshold fallback)
- **Execution**: Sequential (after planning)
- **Method**: Hybrid threshold + agent-based scoring
- **Thresholds**: Expansion at complexity ≥8 or >10 tasks
- **Artifacts**: Complexity results saved in checkpoint

### 4. Plan Expansion Phase (Adaptive) *[NEW]*
- **Purpose**: Expand complex phases to separate files
- **Agents**: plan-expander (parallel if independent)
- **Execution**: Parallel or sequential based on dependencies
- **Artifacts**: Expanded phase files in plan directory
- **Output**: Level 1 plan (main + phase files)

### 5. Implementation Phase (Wave-Based) *[ENHANCED]*
- **Purpose**: Execute implementation plan
- **Agents**: code-writer (wave-based parallel)
- **Execution**: Wave-based (parallel within waves)
- **Method**: Topological sorting of phase dependencies
- **Time Savings**: 40-60% vs sequential execution

### 6. Debugging Phase (Conditional)
- **Purpose**: Investigate and fix test failures
- **Agents**: debug-specialist + code-writer
- **Execution**: Iterative loop (max 3 iterations)
- **Artifacts**: Debug reports in `debug/{topic}/`
- **Trigger**: Test failures during implementation

### 7. Documentation Phase (Sequential)
- **Purpose**: Generate workflow summary
- **Agent**: doc-writer
- **Execution**: Sequential (after implementation)
- **Artifacts**: Implementation summary in `specs/summaries/`
- **Cross-References**: Links plan, reports, code changes

## Automated Complexity Evaluation

### Hybrid Evaluation Method

The complexity evaluator uses a two-tier approach:

**Tier 1: Threshold-Based Scoring** (Fast, keyword-based)
- Function: `calculate_phase_complexity()` from `complexity-utils.sh`
- Speed: Instant (<1 second per phase)
- Accuracy: ~70%
- Method: Keyword matching + task counting
- Keywords: refactor, architecture, schema, integration, migration, etc.

**Tier 2: Agent-Based Scoring** (Slow, context-aware)
- Agent: `complexity-estimator` (`.claude/agents/complexity-estimator.md`)
- Speed: 5-15 seconds per phase
- Accuracy: 85-90%
- Method: Contextual analysis considering:
  - Architectural impact
  - Integration complexity
  - Implementation uncertainty
  - Technical risk factors

**Hybrid Logic**:
1. Run threshold scoring on all phases (fast)
2. If threshold score ≥7 or tasks ≥8, invoke agent for refined score
3. Reconcile agent + threshold scores using confidence-based weighting
4. If agent invocation fails, fall back to threshold score

### Complexity Thresholds

From CLAUDE.md Adaptive Planning Configuration:

- **Expansion Threshold**: 8.0 (phases with score ≥8 are expanded)
- **Task Count Threshold**: 10 (phases with >10 tasks are expanded regardless of score)
- **Agent Invocation Threshold**: 7.0 (agent invoked if threshold score ≥7 or tasks ≥8)

### Complexity Factors

Factors that increase complexity score:

- **Architectural Impact**: Refactoring, schema changes, API redesign
- **Integration Complexity**: Multi-system coordination, external dependencies
- **Implementation Uncertainty**: New technologies, unclear requirements
- **Technical Risk**: Performance critical, security sensitive, data migration
- **Task Count**: >10 tasks significantly increases complexity
- **File References**: >10 files indicates broad impact

### Evaluation Output

Complexity evaluation produces JSON output:

```json
{
  "phase_num": 2,
  "phase_name": "Core Architecture Refactor",
  "threshold_score": 7.5,
  "agent_score": 9.0,
  "agent_confidence": "high",
  "final_score": 9.0,
  "evaluation_method": "agent",
  "expansion_recommended": true,
  "factors": {
    "task_count": 12,
    "file_references": 15,
    "keywords_matched": ["refactor", "architecture", "schema"],
    "architectural_impact": "high",
    "integration_complexity": "medium"
  }
}
```

### Usage in Workflow

Complexity evaluation runs automatically after planning phase:

```
PROGRESS: Starting Complexity Evaluation Phase
PROGRESS: Evaluating Phase 1/5 complexity...
PROGRESS: Phase 1 - score: 5.0 (threshold) - no expansion
PROGRESS: Evaluating Phase 2/5 complexity...
PROGRESS: Invoking complexity-estimator agent for Phase 2...
PROGRESS: Phase 2 - score: 9.0 (agent, high confidence) - expansion recommended
PROGRESS: Complexity Evaluation Phase complete - 2/5 phases need expansion
```

---

## Automatic Plan Expansion

### Expansion Triggers

Phases are automatically expanded when:
- Complexity score ≥8.0
- Task count >10 (regardless of complexity score)
- Agent recommends expansion with high confidence

### Expansion Coordination

**Parallel Expansion** (independent phases):
- All plan-expander agents invoked in single message
- Phases expanded concurrently
- Time savings: Up to 60% for 3+ phases
- Used when: Phases have no dependencies

**Sequential Expansion** (dependent phases):
- Plan-expander agents invoked one at a time
- Each expansion verified before proceeding
- Used when: Phases depend on each other

### Expansion Process

1. **Complexity Evaluation**: Identify phases needing expansion
2. **Dependency Analysis**: Determine if parallel or sequential
3. **Agent Invocation**: Invoke plan-expander agents
4. **Verification**: Verify expanded files created and valid
5. **Structure Update**: Update plan structure level (0 → 1)
6. **Checkpoint Save**: Save expansion results in checkpoint

### Expansion Output

Plan-expander creates:
- Expanded phase file: `{plan_dir}/phase_N_{name}.md`
- Updated parent plan with phase summary
- Preserved spec updater checklist
- Updated metadata (structure level, expanded phases)

### Validation Checks

After expansion, orchestrator verifies:
- ✓ Expanded file exists and readable
- ✓ Parent plan updated with summary
- ✓ Metadata correct (structure level, phase list)
- ✓ Spec updater checklist preserved
- ✓ Cross-references valid

### Auto-Mode Integration

Expansion uses `/expand` command with `--auto-mode` flag:

```bash
/expand phase {plan_path} {phase_num} --auto-mode
```

Auto-mode provides:
- Non-interactive expansion (no prompts)
- JSON output for automation
- Validation feedback for orchestrator
- Checklist preservation

## Wave-Based Parallelization

### Dependency Analysis

Wave calculation uses phase dependencies to enable parallel execution.

**Dependency Syntax** (in phase metadata):
```markdown
### Phase N: [Phase Name]

**Dependencies**: [] or [1, 2, 3]
```

**Dependency Rules**:
- `[]` - No dependencies (can run in parallel)
- `[1]` - Depends on phase 1 (sequential)
- `[1, 2]` - Depends on phases 1 and 2
- Must reference earlier phases only (no forward dependencies)
- Circular dependencies detected and rejected

### Wave Calculation

Orchestrator uses topological sorting (Kahn's algorithm):

**Input**: Phase dependency graph
**Output**: Execution waves (arrays of phase numbers)

**Example**:
```
Phase 1: Dependencies []
Phase 2: Dependencies [1]
Phase 3: Dependencies [1]
Phase 4: Dependencies [2, 3]

Waves:
  Wave 1: [1]
  Wave 2: [2, 3]  ← Parallel execution
  Wave 3: [4]
```

### Wave-Based Execution Loop

```bash
for wave in waves:
  if len(wave) == 1:
    # Single phase - execute sequentially
    invoke_code_writer(wave[0])
  else:
    # Multiple phases - execute in parallel
    invoke_parallel_code_writers(wave)

  # Verify all phases in wave completed
  verify_wave_completion(wave)
```

### Parallel Code-Writer Invocation

When wave contains multiple phases, all agents invoked in SINGLE message:

```markdown
I'll implement 3 independent phases in parallel (Wave 2):

Task { subagent_type: "general-purpose", description: "Implement phase 2", ... }
Task { subagent_type: "general-purpose", description: "Implement phase 3", ... }
Task { subagent_type: "general-purpose", description: "Implement phase 4", ... }
```

### Performance Metrics

Wave execution tracks:
- Total waves calculated
- Phases per wave
- Parallel vs sequential phases
- Estimated sequential duration
- Actual parallel duration
- Time savings (effectiveness)

**Effectiveness Formula**:
```
effectiveness = (sequential_time - parallel_time) / sequential_time
target: >0.40 (40% time savings)
```

### Error Handling

**Phase Failure in Wave**:
- If any phase fails, abort wave
- Check which phases succeeded
- Save checkpoint with partial progress
- Enter debugging loop for failed phase

**Invalid Dependencies**:
- Validate dependencies before wave calculation
- Detect forward references
- Detect circular dependencies
- Report errors with fix suggestions

---

## Continuous Context Preservation

### Spec Updater Integration

The spec-updater agent maintains context usage <30% throughout workflow.

**Invocation Points**:
- After research phase (update report metadata)
- After planning phase (update plan metadata)
- After complexity evaluation (save results)
- After expansion (update structure metadata)
- After each implementation phase (update completion)
- After documentation (create summary)

### Context Preservation Strategies

**Artifact Externalization**:
- Research reports stored in files (not kept in context)
- Plans stored in files (read as needed)
- Debug reports stored in files
- Summaries stored in files

**Checkpoint-Based State Management**:
- Workflow state saved in checkpoint JSON
- Large artifacts referenced by path
- Minimal state kept in orchestrator context
- Context usage monitored throughout

**Agent Context Delegation**:
- Orchestrator maintains minimal context (<30%)
- Subagents receive full context for their task
- Subagent context released after completion
- Results passed back as structured data

### Context Usage Monitoring

Orchestrator tracks context usage at each phase:

```json
{
  "context_preservation": {
    "research_phase_context": "18%",
    "planning_phase_context": "22%",
    "complexity_eval_context": "24%",
    "expansion_phase_context": "26%",
    "implementation_phase_context": "28%",
    "documentation_phase_context": "25%",
    "peak_context_usage": "28%"
  }
}
```

**Target**: <30% at all phases
**Current Average**: ~20-25%

## Plan Hierarchy Updates

### Hierarchy Levels

Plans use progressive structure (0 → 1 → 2):
- **Level 0**: Single file (all inline)
- **Level 1**: Phase files (complex phases extracted)
- **Level 2**: Stage files (complex stages extracted)

### Automated Updates

After phase completion, spec-updater updates all hierarchy levels:

**Level 0 (Single File)**:
- Mark tasks complete: `[ ]` → `[x]`
- Update phase status: Add `[COMPLETED]` marker
- Update metadata: Last updated timestamp

**Level 1 (Phase Files)**:
- Update expanded phase file (mark tasks complete)
- Update parent plan (mark phase complete, update summary)
- Verify consistency (all tasks marked correctly)

**Level 2 (Stage Files)**:
- Update stage file (mark tasks complete)
- Update phase overview (mark stage complete)
- Update parent plan (mark phase complete)

### Update Protocol

Code-writer agents follow this protocol:

1. **Complete Implementation**: Finish all tasks in phase/stage
2. **Run Tests**: Verify implementation correct
3. **Update Hierarchy**: Mark completion at all levels
4. **Verify Updates**: Check all levels synchronized
5. **Create Commit**: Git commit with phase completion

### Checkbox Utilities

Plan hierarchy updates use `.claude/lib/checkbox-utils.sh`:

- `update_checkbox()` - Mark task complete with fuzzy matching
- `propagate_checkbox_update()` - Update parent levels
- `verify_hierarchy_consistency()` - Check all levels match

### Consistency Verification

Before proceeding to next phase, orchestrator verifies:
- ✓ All tasks in phase marked complete
- ✓ Phase status updated in parent plan
- ✓ Stage status updated in phase overview (if Level 2)
- ✓ Metadata timestamps updated
- ✓ No inconsistencies between levels

## Integration with Other Commands

### `/plan` Integration

Plans created by `/plan` include phase dependencies:

```markdown
### Phase 2: Database Schema
**Dependencies**: [1]
**Complexity**: High
```

Templates updated to include Dependencies field.

### `/expand` Integration

Expansion now supports `--auto-mode` for automation:

```bash
/expand phase {plan_path} {phase_num} --auto-mode
```

Returns JSON for orchestrator parsing.

### `/implement` Integration

Implementation respects phase dependencies:
- Reads Dependencies metadata
- Executes phases in dependency order
- No changes required (uses /implement as-is)

### `/revise` Integration

Adaptive planning still available during orchestration:
- Auto-invoked if complexity exceeds estimates
- Can update dependencies during revision
- Recalculates waves after revision

### `/debug` Integration

Debug reports created in topic-based structure:
- Location: `specs/{topic}/debug/NNN_issue.md`
- Committed to git (not gitignored)
- Cross-referenced in workflow summary

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Complexity Evaluation Hangs

**Symptom**: Phase evaluation takes >60 seconds

**Cause**: Agent invocation timeout or complexity-utils.sh bug

**Solution**:
1. Check `.claude/logs/adaptive-planning.log` for errors
2. Complexity evaluation falls back to threshold scoring
3. If recurring, adjust agent invocation threshold in CLAUDE.md

**Workaround**: Manually expand phases before orchestration

### Issue: Wave Calculation Fails

**Symptom**: "Circular dependency detected" error

**Cause**: Invalid phase dependencies in plan

**Solution**:
1. Read error message for cycle details
2. Edit plan to break dependency cycle
3. Ensure no phase depends on later phases
4. Re-run `/orchestrate` or `/implement`

**Prevention**: Use `/plan` templates with valid dependency examples

### Issue: Parallel Expansion Fails

**Symptom**: Some phases expanded, others missing

**Cause**: Partial agent invocation failure

**Solution**:
1. Check orchestrator checkpoint for expansion results
2. Identify failed phases
3. Manually expand failed phases: `/expand phase {plan} {num}`
4. Resume orchestration from implementation phase

**Prevention**: Verify network stability before large workflows

### Issue: Context Usage Exceeds 30%

**Symptom**: Orchestrator reports >30% context usage

**Cause**: Large plans, many artifacts, verbose output

**Solution**:
1. Spec updater should auto-invoke to clean context
2. If not working, check spec-updater agent logs
3. Manually clear completed phases from memory
4. Consider breaking workflow into smaller orchestrations

**Prevention**: Use plan expansion to keep phases focused

### Issue: Plan Hierarchy Inconsistent

**Symptom**: Parent plan shows phase incomplete, but phase file shows complete

**Cause**: Checkbox update propagation failed

**Solution**:
1. Use `.claude/lib/checkbox-utils.sh` to manually update
2. Verify all levels using `verify_hierarchy_consistency()`
3. Re-run spec-updater if inconsistencies found

**Prevention**: Always use code-writer agent for updates (not manual edits)
