## 🛠️ Development Guidelines

### Principles
1. **Clean Architecture**: Remove backwards compatibility to focus on clear, consistent, and maintainable configuration
2. **Incremental Progress**: Small, tested changes over big rewrites
3. **User First**: Features that provide immediate user value take priority
4. **Event-Driven**: New features should use the event system
5. **Well-Tested**: Each feature needs appropriate test coverage

### Working with Specs
1. Each spec is self-contained with implementation details
2. Cross-reference specs when features overlap
3. Update specs as implementation reveals new insights
4. Create GitHub issues from spec sections for tracking

### Code Organization
