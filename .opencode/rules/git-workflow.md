# Git Workflow Rules

## Commit Conventions

### Task-Scoped Commits

All commits related to tasks use this format:

```
task {N}: {action} {description}
```

### Standard Actions

| Operation               | Commit Message                         |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Create task             | `task {N}: create {title}`             |
| Complete research       | `task {N}: complete research`          |
| Create plan             | `task {N}: create implementation plan` |
| Complete phase          | `task {N} phase {P}: {phase_name}`     |
| Complete implementation | `task {N}: complete implementation`    |
| Revise plan             | `task {N}: revise plan (v{V})`         |

### System Operations

| Operation     | Commit Message                                      |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Archive tasks | `todo: archive {N} completed tasks`                 |
| Error fixes   | `errors: create fix plan for {N} errors (task {M})` |
| Review        | `review: {summary}`                                 |
| State sync    | `sync: reconcile TODO.md and state.json`            |

## Commit Timing

### Create Commits After

- Task creation (includes TODO.md + state.json updates)
- Research completion (includes report file)
- Plan creation (includes plan file)
- Each implementation phase completion
- Final implementation completion (includes summary)
- Task archival operations

### Do Not Commit

- Partial/incomplete work
- Failed operations (rollback instead)
- Intermediate states during multi-phase operations

## Commit Scope

### Single-Task Operations

Include only files related to that task:

```
task 334: complete research

Modified:
  specs/TODO.md
  specs/state.json
  specs/334_task_slug/reports/research-001.md
```

### Multi-Task Operations

Group related changes:

```
todo: archive 5 completed tasks

Modified:
  specs/TODO.md
  specs/state.json
  specs/archive/state.json
```

## Git Safety

### Never Run

- `git push --force` to main/master
- `git reset --hard` without explicit user request
- `git rebase -i` (interactive mode not supported)
- Any destructive operations without user confirmation

### Always Check Before Commit

- `git status` to verify staged files
- `git diff --staged` to review changes
- Ensure no sensitive files (.env, credentials) are staged

## Commit Message Format

```
{scope}: {action} {description}

Session: {session_id}

# Co-Authored-By line intentionally removed for model-agnostic system
```

### Session ID

Session ID links commits to their originating command execution.

**Format**: `sess_{unix_timestamp}_{6_char_random}`
**Example**: `sess_1736700000_a1b2c3`

**Generation**:

```bash
# Portable command (works on NixOS, macOS, Linux - no xxd dependency)
session_id="sess_$(date +%s)_$(od -An -N3 -tx1 /dev/urandom | tr -d ' ')"
```

**Lifecycle**:

1. Generated at CHECKPOINT 1 (GATE IN)
2. Passed through delegation to skill/agent
3. Included in error logs for traceability
4. Included in final git commit

### Examples

```
task 334: create LaTeX documentation for Logos system

Session: sess_1736700000_a1b2c3

# Co-Authored-By line intentionally removed for model-agnostic system
```

```
task 259 phase 2: implement modal semantics evaluator

Session: sess_1736701234_d4e5f6

# Co-Authored-By line intentionally removed for model-agnostic system
```

```
todo: archive 3 completed tasks (336, 337, 338)

Session: sess_1736702000_789abc

# Co-Authored-By line intentionally removed for model-agnostic system
```

## Branch Strategy

### Main Development

- Work on `main` or feature branches
- Commit frequently with descriptive messages
- Keep commits atomic (one logical change per commit)

### Task Branches (Optional)

For complex multi-phase implementations:

```
task-{N}-{slug}
```

## Error Handling

### On Commit Failure

1. Log the failure
2. Do not block the operation
3. Preserve changes for manual commit
4. Report to user that commit failed

### On Pre-Commit Hook Failure

1. Do not use --no-verify
2. Fix the issue
3. Create new commit (never amend failed commits)
