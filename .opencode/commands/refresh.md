# /refresh Command

Comprehensive cleanup of Claude Code resources - terminate orphaned processes and clean up ~/.opencode/ directory.

## Syntax

```
/refresh [--dry-run] [--force]
```

## Options

| Flag        | Description                                                                      |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--dry-run` | Preview both process and directory cleanup without making changes                |
| `--force`   | Skip confirmation and execute immediately (8-hour default for directory cleanup) |
| (no flags)  | Interactive mode with process cleanup and age threshold selection                |

## What It Cleans

### Process Cleanup

Identifies and terminates orphaned Claude Code processes (detached processes without a controlling terminal).

### Directory Cleanup

Cleans accumulated files in ~/.opencode/:

| Directory        | Contents                                |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| projects/        | Session .jsonl files and subdirectories |
| debug/           | Debug output files                      |
| file-history/    | File version snapshots                  |
| todos/           | Todo list backups                       |
| session-env/     | Environment snapshots                   |
| telemetry/       | Usage telemetry data                    |
| shell-snapshots/ | Shell state                             |
| plugins/cache/   | Old plugin versions                     |
| cache/           | General cache                           |

## Interactive Mode

When run without flags, `/refresh` operates in interactive mode:

1. **Process cleanup**: Shows orphaned processes and prompts for confirmation
2. **Directory cleanup**: Shows cleanup candidates and prompts for age threshold:
   - **8 hours (default)** - Remove files older than 8 hours
   - **2 days** - Remove files older than 2 days (conservative)
   - **Clean slate** - Remove everything except safety margin

## Execution

Invoke skill-refresh with the provided arguments:

```
skill: skill-refresh
args: {flags from command}
```

The skill executes both cleanup types sequentially:

1. Process cleanup (using opencode-refresh.sh)
2. Directory cleanup (using opencode-cleanup.sh)

## Safety

### Protected Files (Never Deleted)

- `sessions-index.json` - System file in each project directory
- `settings.json` - User settings
- `.credentials.json` - Authentication credentials
- `history.jsonl` - User command history

### Safety Margin

Files modified within the last hour are **never deleted**, regardless of age threshold.

### Process Protection

- Only targets processes without a controlling terminal (TTY = "?")
- Never kills active Claude Code sessions
- Excludes current process tree

## Examples

### Interactive Cleanup (Recommended)

```bash
# Show status, prompt for process cleanup, then prompt for age selection
/refresh
```

### Preview Mode

```bash
# Show what would be cleaned without making changes
/refresh --dry-run
```

### Automated Cleanup

```bash
# Skip prompts, clean with 8-hour default
/refresh --force
```

## Output

### Survey Output

```
Claude Code Refresh
===================

No orphaned processes found.
All 3 Claude processes are active sessions.

Current total size: 7.3 GB

Age threshold: 8 hours
Safety margin: 1 hour (files modified within last hour are preserved)

TOTAL                      7.3 GB       6.7 GB     5577

Space that can be reclaimed: 6.7 GB
```

### After Cleanup

```
Cleanup Complete
================
Deleted: 5577 files
Failed:  0 files
Space reclaimed: 6.7 GB

New total size: 600.0 MB
```

### Dry Run

```
Dry Run Summary
===============
Would delete: 5577 files
Would reclaim: 6.7 GB
```

## Troubleshooting

### No cleanup candidates found

All files are either protected or within the selected age threshold. This is normal for a recently-used system.

### Permission denied

Some processes may require elevated permissions to terminate. Run as root if needed, or manually kill specific processes.

### Large cleanup size

If ~/.opencode/ is very large (>5GB), consider starting with the "2 days" option to preserve recent work, then progressively clean older files.
